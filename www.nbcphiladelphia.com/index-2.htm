				<![CDATA[
<p>Two Green Bay Packers fans from Pennsylvania are speaking out after <a href="https://x.com/Basaraski/status/1878695599484346675" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/Basaraski/status/1878695599484346675">a viral video</a> of them being harassed by a foulmouthed Eagles fan during Sunday’s wild card game sparked outrage across the country.</p>



<p>Alex Basara and his fiancée Ally Keller, both of Chester County, told NBC10 they attended the Eagles-Packers game at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday. The couple said they first met up with a few friends who are Eagles fans before the game and engaged in fun banter. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ninety-nine percent of Eagles fans were playful banter,” Basara said. “The normal. I’ve been to 20 plus stadiums and it’s normally like that. Eagles is a little bit more harsh sometimes but it’s all in playful fun. They’ll say things to you but then they’ll shake your hand. They’ll say, ‘Hey, have a good time in the stadium.’”</p>



<p>Basara and Keller said the environment was friendly at the start. That was until an Eagles fan sitting behind them began to make comments during the game.</p>



<p>“He started out with playful jabs at first or kind of just saying things to us right when we sat down,” Basara said. “I chatted with him for a bit. But then he just kept saying some of the same things. Continued through the entire game. It got worse and worse as the game went on. We were surrounded by Eagles fans. We were getting all the attention.”</p>



<p>Basara and Keller said the fan became nastier and more condescending as the Eagles’ lead over the Packers grew. When the fan asked Basara if he was having a good time, Basara told him “not too great.” That’s when the fan told the couple that they had “terrible attitudes,” according to Keller.</p>



<p>“He went on to say that when he was in third grade, his teacher taught him to have a great attitude. And he was just going on and on and on,” Keller said. “He wanted something out of us. So, I turned around, because I kind of had enough of it at this point, and I said, ‘Well, maybe you should go back to third grade then because it seems like you’re the one with the bad attitude. And it seems like all the fans around us are the ones with the bad attitudes.’”</p>



<p>Keller said the fan appeared to not have heard her at first. He then insulted her.</p>



<p>“And then he just said, ‘Actually, you’re not even good looking enough to be talking to me,’” Keller told NBC10. “And then I said, you know, ‘What does that mean?’ And he said, ‘You know what that means.’ And so I said, ‘Have you looked in the mirror yourself?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, but I’m a man. I’m allowed to be ugly. You’re a woman.”</p>



<p>Keller and Basara said the fan’s harassment continued. Basara then spoke to a man who he believed was the fan’s brother and asked if he could get him under control. Basara said he also offered to switch seats with Keller but she didn’t want to.</p>



<p>“We both paid for tickets. We should both be able to enjoy the game. It was kind of like a pride thing,” Keller said. “Where it was like, no, I’m going to stand my ground. He could say these words to me and be mean to me but I’m not going to give him the satisfaction of changing my seat for him. And in hindsight, maybe I should’ve.”</p>

<p>Basara began to record the fan as the insults continued. <a href="https://x.com/Basaraski/status/1878695599484346675">In a video that went viral</a> after Basara posted it on his X account, the fan could be heard calling Keller a “dips&#8212;” and a “c&#8212;.”</p>



<p>The couple said they felt the environment turning hostile.</p>



<p>“He was making personal jabs at me,” Keller said. “It’s one thing if he’s going, ‘F the Packers,’ or whatever. But he’s talking about my looks the whole time. So, it got personal at that point.”</p>



<p>Despite her anger, Keller told NBC10 she was hesitant to lash out too much.</p>



<p>“There’s no women. There’s nobody defending me. There’s all Eagles fans allowing this to happen,” she said. “So, I didn’t want to turn around and yell at this guy and then have my fiancé get jumped in the crowd. So I was I guess trying to stay calm but I was pretty fuming at that point and just hopeful that another fan would tell this guy to stop. And everyone just kind of stood around and I guess allowed him to call me that name.”</p>



<p>Basara also said he tried to keep calm in order to keep them both safe.</p>



<p>“Everyone else around you is an Eagles fan,” Basara said. “And for the people around us that didn’t hear it because it’s a loud environment, if it did turn into an altercation or something physical, all they see is me messing with an Eagles fan and then I become the target. And then what happens with my fiancée at that time in that scenario? It’s a dangerous situation.”</p>



<p>Basara said him recording the fan is ultimately what helped deescalate the situation.</p>



<p>“His friend realized he was being recorded and tapped him and he stopped,” Basara said. “That was my way of deescalating the situation and making sure that both of us got out safe. Which we did. We both got out safe and then later in the game we moved to the end of the row because at that point a lot of fans had left because the game was essentially over and we made sure to also leave before that group of people so they weren’t behind us walking down the steps.”</p>



<p>Basara said they left without contacting security because they didn’t realize there was a QR code with a security contact on their seats. They later spoke with the Eagles on Monday and the team apologized for the fan’s behavior. Despite reports stating the team would gift them free Packers gear, Basara and Keller said they haven’t received that message from the team as of yet.</p>



<p>“I’ve seen posts that they’re going to send me Packers gear but they haven’t reached out personally to say that,” Keller said. “So I don’t know if it’s just people just saying that.”</p>



<p>After their experience, Basara and Keller said the only Eagles games they’ll attend in the future will be in Green Bay.</p>



<p>“In Lambeau, sure. I don’t think we’ll go to Philly again just because at this rate I don’t know if it’s necessarily worth it,” Basara said. “And I know not every fan is like that and I really hope no one has to endure that. And that was kind of my point of posting that video. Hopefully, this will make people understand that’s not okay. That’s not okay to do.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the Eagles told NBC10 that the incident has been addressed and that the fan who harassed Basara and Keller won’t be allowed to attend any future events at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>



<p>NBC10 has also made several attempts to reach out to the Eagles fan in the video. We have not yet heard back from him.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A teenage boy who was a top student and basketball player was shot and killed in the alleyway behind his North Philadelphia rowhome as he was getting into the car with his mom Tuesday morning, officials say.</p>



<p>Several shots were fired at the 17-year-old &#8212; who family and school officials identified as Noah Scurry &#8212; behind the Rorer Street rowhomes, near Roosevelt Boulevard, in the Feltonville neighborhood just before 7:15 a.m. on Jan 14, 2025, Philadelphia police said. </p>



<p>He was getting into a car to go to school at <a href="https://fels.philasd.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fels.philasd.org/">Samuel Fels High School</a> with his mom when he was shot, School District of Philadelphia spokesperson Monique Braxton said.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/tiroteo-mortal-rorer-street-filadelfia/2459734/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/tiroteo-mortal-rorer-street-filadelfia/2459734/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Léelo&nbsp;en español aquí</a></em>.</p>



<p>Scurry was struck throughout his body, police said. Medics rushed the teen to a nearby hospital where he died a short time later.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">
<p><em>There are additional resources for people or communities that have endured gun violence in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://resolvephilly.org/gun-violence-resource/" target="_blank"><em>Further information can be found here.</em></a></p>
</div>



<p>Police didn&#8217;t immediately reveal a motive or announce any arrests in the shooting. Police initially said a gun was recovered, however, in an afternoon update law enforcement said that wasn&#8217;t the case.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Top student and Fels High School basketball player</strong></h2>



<p>Scurry who was shot and killed near his home had recently posted the top score among his class on the SATs, Fels principal Melissa Rasper said in a letter to the school community.</p>



<p>&#8220;The student recently scored the highest among the Fels community on the SAT college placement tests,&#8221; Rasper wrote. </p>



<p>He was also a member of the Fels Panthers boys basketball team.</p>



<p>&#8220;He also played on the basketball team and for that reason, our boys basketball games will be cancelled for the remainder of the week,&#8221; Rasper wrote.</p>



<p>The school is offering counseling and support for students grappling with their classmate&#8217;s death.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ours is a tight-knit community, and I know that this is difficult news to receive even when it doesn’t occur on school property,&#8221; Rasper wrote. &#8220;Death is rarely something that is easy to accept, especially when it involves a young person, a classmate and particularly during these times as our city grapples with heightened gun violence.&#8221;</p>



<p>Monique Braxton, with the School District of Philadelphia, announced that all after school activities were canceled on Tuesday.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a horrible day. This is something that no one imagined,&#8221; Braxton said. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">A community in mourning</h2>



<p>Family members gathered at a home in Feltonville on Tuesday morning, mourning the loss of Noah Scurry. </p>



<p>One neighbor told NBC10 that they were eating breakfast when they heard multiple gunshots. </p>



<p>&#8220;Very scary. Very scary. It was multiple shots at once,&#8221; one neighbor told NBC10. &#8220;The first thing I thought was to grab my son and throw him on the floor.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Children at the center of gun violence</strong></h2>



<p>This is at least the third shooting of a child in Philadelphia so far this year, according to shooting <a href="https://controller.phila.gov/philadelphia-reports/mapping-gun-violence/#/?year=2025&amp;map=11.00%2F39.98500%2F-75.15000" data-type="link" data-id="https://controller.phila.gov/philadelphia-reports/mapping-gun-violence/#/?year=2025&amp;map=11.00%2F39.98500%2F-75.15000">data gathered by the City Controller&#8217;s Office</a>. </p>



<p>Entering Tuesday, at least seven homicides have been reported in 2025, according to <a href="https://www.phillypolice.com/crimestats/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.phillypolice.com/crimestats/">Philadelphia police data.</a> That&#8217;s the lowest year-to-date homicide total since 2019.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A Philadelphia police officer was injured in a crash on Tuesday when a truck driver fled down a South Philadelphia sidewalk and refused to stop as officers approached the vehicle.</p>



<p>Much of the incident was caught on camera in video that has been obtained by NBC10. </p>


<div data-react-component='VideoPlaylist' data-props='{&quot;accountId&quot;:&quot;Yh1nAC&quot;,&quot;autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;brand&quot;:&quot;nbc&quot;,&quot;host&quot;:&quot;nbcphiladelphia.com&quot;,&quot;twitter&quot;:&quot;nbcphiladelphia&quot;,&quot;callLetters&quot;:&quot;WCAU&quot;,&quot;station&quot;:&quot;NBC 10 PHILADELPHIA&quot;,&quot;excludeEndCard&quot;:false,&quot;islead&quot;:false,&quot;fastSchedule&quot;:[],&quot;videos&quot;:[{&quot;mediaId&quot;:&quot;31QxepkChBvz&quot;,&quot;poster&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/media.nbcphiladelphia.com\/2025\/01\/37152798314-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;resize=850%2C478&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Surveillance footage shows truck flee on South Philly sidewalk&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.nbcphiladelphia.com\/news\/local\/surveillance-footage-shows-truck-flee-on-south-philly-sidewalk\/4077775\/&quot;,&quot;videoContentId&quot;:&quot;1:12:4077775&quot;,&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;2401666627743&quot;,&quot;isLivestream&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;isFast&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;m3uPid&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;mp4Url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/prodamdlim.akamaized.net\/NBCU_LM_VMS_WCAU\/744\/799\/37152798314-1080pnbcnews6m.mp4&quot;,&quot;m3u8Url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;catNames&quot;:{&quot;282048&quot;:&quot;News&quot;,&quot;441&quot;:&quot;Local&quot;},&quot;tagNames&quot;:{&quot;6750&quot;:&quot;South Philadelphia&quot;},&quot;contentSource&quot;:&quot;NBC&quot;,&quot;sentiment&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;topic&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;origination&quot;:&quot;WCAU&quot;,&quot;sponsorName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;datePublished&quot;:&quot;2025-01-14T14:56:27&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:61,&quot;syndicated_id&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;videoSport&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;videoLeague&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;videoTeam&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;show&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;genre&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;originCallLetters&quot;:&quot;WCAU&quot;,&quot;canonicalUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.nbcphiladelphia.com\/news\/local\/surveillance-footage-shows-truck-flee-on-south-philly-sidewalk\/4077775\/&quot;,&quot;sensitivity&quot;:[],&quot;disableEmbed&quot;:false}]}'></div>


<p>The incident began just before 11 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025, when, officials said, police officers were attempting to pull over the driver of a red pickup truck near the intersection of 9th Street and Snyder Avenue.</p>



<p>At that time, as can be seen in the video obtained by NBC10, the driver attempted to avoid the police by driving onto the sidewalk, only to be halted by a police vehicle.</p>



<p>The driver then reverses down the sidewalk as officers shout and attempt to get the driver to exit the vehicle, as can be seen in the footage. </p>



<p>&#8220;We thought we were going to get hit for sure because I couldn’t go any faster without going through the stop sign so I had to get to the next stop sign to get to the side and he almost took the whole side of my truck off when he went by me,&#8221; said one witness who declined to be identified in this story. </p>



<p>At some point in this incident, the officers break a window in the truck and, it appears, they deploy a taser on the driver. The driver, as can be seen in the footage, accelerates, pushing the officers aside as the vehicle heads back down the sidewalk. </p>



<p>Eventually, police said that they were able to arrest the driver of this truck, but, contacted Tuesday afternoon, officials did not share the driver&#8217;s identity and have not said just what charges the individual may face as a result of this incident. </p>



<p>The officer that was hurt was taken to a nearby hospital where, officials said, they were expected to be treated and released. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The race for the District Attorney&#8217;s Office in Philadelphia is kicking off. </p>



<p>Former municipal court judge Pat Dugan has thrown his hat into the ring in a bid to replace District Attorney Larry Krasner. </p>



<p>&#8220;I had a front row seat to some of the policies that just don&#8217;t make sense to me and I couldn&#8217;t take it any longer,&#8221; Judge Dugan said. </p>



<p>Krasner, a democrat, was elected to office twice and has the option to run again but would not say if he is yet when he spoke with NBC10 on Tuesday, Jan. 14. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’ll just say that I’ll be making an announcement in about the next 30 days,&#8221; Krasner said when asked if he&#8217;s going to run again. &#8220;I will be making an announcement that is consistent with the fact that I love this job.&#8221; </p>



<p>Krasner explained that he has known Dugan professionally for a long time but he wouldn&#8217;t comment specifically on Dugan&#8217;s work as a judge. </p>



<p>When asked what he would tell Philadelphians who want a change at the DA&#8217;s office, Krasner said, &#8220;What I say to people is vote. Vote your conscience. Vote your beliefs. Vote.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dugan was in Northeast Philadelphia on Tuesday with his family to accept an endorsement from the Building Trades union as he launches a citywide campaign to replace the currently two-term District Attorney. </p>



<p>Dugan addressed Krasner&#8217;s work as District Attorney and the state of crime in the city. </p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how his policies have had anything to contribute to any downward spiral in the crime rate,&#8221; Dugan told NBC10. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure how you think Larry Krasner has slowed down the homicide rate.&#8221; </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>New Jersey is going to build up a supply of medication used in abortions, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy announced Tuesday during his state of the state address as he both pledged to work with President-elect Donald Trump and warned that the state is ready to push back against the incoming administration.</p>

<p>Murphy is one of a handful of Democratic governors who criticized Trump on the campaign trail yet now say they are open to cooperation. But Murphy said he will not back down in the face of “anti-choice” policies supported by the Republican majorities in Congress. He said the state will stockpile mifepristone “so every woman can access this crucial form of reproductive care.” </p>

<p>“I will never back away from partnering with the Trump Administration where our priorities align,” Murphy said during his address before a joint meeting of the Democrat-led Legislature. “But just as importantly, I will never back down from defending our New Jersey values — if and when they are tested.”</p>

<p>New Jersey joins other Democrat-led states, including Massachusetts and California, in stockpiling mifepristone, one of two drugs used in combination to end pregnancies. </p>

<p>During an interview with NBC News last month, Trump said he doesn’t plan to restrict medication abortion, but he also seemed to leave the door open, saying “things change.” Abortion rights groups are particularly concerned that Trump’s choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi, may revive the Comstock Act, an anti-vice law passed by Congress in 1873 that, among other things, bans the mailing of medication or instruments used in abortion.</p>

<p>Tuesday’s speech was Murphy’s second-to-last, and he emphasized his reluctance to become a lame-duck governor in the final stretch of his second term. Among the other proposals he unveiled, Murphy said he would direct schools to ban cellphones in grades K-12. </p>

<p>“Our children are inundated with screens,” he said. “And they are making it incredibly difficult for our kids, not only to learn, but to retain the substance of what they learn.”</p>

<p>Republicans, who are in the minority, panned the speech, saying the governor is on the verge of overspending the state&#8217;s means</p>

<p>“These progressive policies you heard about today are choking our families,” said Republican Senate leader Anthony Bucco. “If we don&#8217;t get this affordability crisis under control, we&#8217;re gonna be in real trouble.”</p>

<p>Murphy is entering the final 12 months of his second term, coinciding with the dawn of a second Trump administration, just as the beginning of his governorship overlapped with Trump’s first term. </p>

<p>Murphy has defined himself as progressive and ran for reelection that way. But his 2021 victory was far narrower than many expected, and his party’s losses in the Legislature saw the Democrats refocus on affordability issues like property tax relief. </p>

<p>“During this final chapter of our journey, our absolute top priority — as it has been since Day One — is delivering economic security and opportunity to every New Jerseyan,” Murphy said. </p>

<p>Now Murphy’s legacy — which includes a lengthy list of legislation thanks to the Democrat-led Legislature like tightening gun laws, legalizing recreational marijuana, taxing the wealthy and boosting education funding — is set against the backdrop of a pitched Democratic primary. </p>

<p>Term-limited from seeking another four years in office, Murphy will be turning the reins of the party over to the eventual winner of a six-person field running for governor in this year’s contest. New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states regularly scheduled with gubernatorial races this year. </p>

<p>Murphy’s vision for the state also coincides with a Democratic Party angling for a way forward and a vote-getting national message after last year’s loss to Trump and the GOP victories, narrow as they are, in Congress. </p>

<p>The speech, analogous to the presidential state of the union address but at the state level, amounts to a blueprint for how the governor wants the year to unfold. </p>

<p>Legislation he sought last year to bar debt collectors from divulging patients’ medical debts to consumer credit reporting agencies, for instance, was enacted. He also succeeded in getting legislation overhauling how affordable housing requirements are managed in the state. </p>

<p>But the speech can also underscore how limited the governor’s power can be. Last year, he called for legislation to permit 16-year-olds to vote in school board elections. The measure hasn’t advanced in the Legislature, though he reiterated his call for the bill on Tuesday. He also called for an “artificial intelligence moonshot.” So far, a task force the governor established has issued a report calling for the state to embrace generative AI. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously preserved access in June to mifepristone, which is used in nearly two-thirds of abortions. The case before the court threatened to cut back access to the drug, including in states where abortion is legal. Abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy in 14 states, and after about six weeks of pregnancy in three others, often before women realize they are pregnant.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A man was convicted of kidnapping a man in Philadelphia and holding his family hostage inside a Bucks County hotel while forcing them to send him money. </p>



<p>Eric Alamo, 48, was found guilty of robbery, kidnapping for ransom, conspiracy, unlawful restraint/serious bodily injury and other related offenses.</p>



<p>On Nov. 11, 2021, Alamo and two other suspects kidnapped a man in the city’s Kensington section, duct taping him to a chair, pistol whipping him and beating him with a knife.</p>



<p>Alamo then took the man’s money via CashApp as well as what he had in his possession. He then took the victim by gunpoint to his car and drove to Harrowgate Plaza to pick up the man’s wife and 9-year-old son.</p>



<p>Alamo then made the victim call his wife and ordered her to bring money and drugs. Before the woman arrived, she called her sister and told her about what was happening, investigators said. Alamo then stole the woman’s belongings and forced her to withdraw money from an ATM. He then drove the victim, his wife and their son to the Lincoln Hotel in Bensalem, Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>Once inside the hotel room, Alamo forced the duct-taped man into the bathtub and made his wife send him multiple CashApp payments. The couple’s son was in the hotel room during the entire ordeal.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the sister of the victim’s wife alerted Bensalem Police to their location. Responding officers entered the hotel room and saw the victim whispering, “help me.” Police then arrested Alamo, recovering the duct tape as well as his pistol.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful for Assistant District Attorney Kyle Russell’s skilled prosecution of this case,&#8221; Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said. &#8220;This conviction shows the excellent and collaborative connection between police and the DA’s office. Thanks to the diligent work of the Bensalem Police Department, specifically the Special Victims Unit, and the Philadelphia Police Department, alongside the work of our capable Homicide and Non-Fatal Shooting Unit, this defendant no longer poses a threat to our community.”</p>

								<excerpt><![CDATA[On Jan. 20, 2025, the region will mark what organizers called, the 'oldest and largest' in the country during the 30th Annual Greater Philadelphia Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service. Here's how you can get involved.]]></excerpt>
								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again, the time to join with neighbors to work together to clean and green the community for the annual Martin Luther King, Jr. </p>



<p>And, this year, to be celebrated on Jan. 20, 2025, the city will celebrate the 30th annual Greater Philadelphia MLK Jr. Day of Service event. </p>



<p>Organizers said that the regional King Day of Service, which includes Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, is the oldest and largest King Day of Service in the nation.</p>



<p>Also, organizers noted that 2025 also marks the 60th anniversary of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/voting-rights-act" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/voting-rights-act" target="_blank">1965 Voting Rights Act</a>.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2025, officials gathered at Girard College in Philadelphia&#8217;s Fairmount neighborhood, to announce details on this year&#8217;s 30th anniversary and note that the college, for the 16th year, would serve as the region&#8217;s signature project site. </p>



<p>“This year’s King federal holiday also marks the inauguration of a new president,” noted Todd Bernstein, president of Global Citizen and founder and director of the Greater Philadelphia King Day of Service in a statement on the day. “It is perhaps more critical now than ever to reaffirm our commitment to Dr. King’s values, principles, and mission, to dedicate ourselves to his legacy—pursuing the cause of justice, fairness, democracy and freedom.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Projects at Girard College on the 30th Annual MLK Jr. Day of Service </h2>



<ul>
<li>Lead sponsor <strong>Independence Blue Cross</strong> will have volunteers sorting and packing toiletry kits, which will be distributed to people in-need living in underserved communities, in partnership with the Mayor Cherelle Parker’s Mayor’s Office of Neighborhood and Community Engagement new mini-City Halls. At the conclusion of the King Day of Service project, the kits will be transported by the City of Philadelphia to the MONCE mini-City Hall at the Church of Christian Compassion / Community of Compassion Inc., 6150 Cedar Ave. West Philadelphia, 19143, for distribution on dates and times to be determined.</li>



<li><strong>Mural Arts Philadelphia</strong> leading Printmaking by the People: Citywide Voices on 2026 &#8211; a hands-on workshop focusing on the Declaration of Independence, printmaking, and the power of posters. The project includes a presentation and discussion led by artists and facilitators in which participants will be asked to reflect on what the rights referenced in the Declaration of Independence—life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness—mean to them today, and what they might add if they were writing a new Declaration today. Participants will design and print posters that reinterpret key ideas in the Declaration. Organizers said that the posters will be used to help inspire a mural in Center City and an exhibition at the Parkway Central Library in 2026, and they will be digitized and made accessible to the public in an online archive.</li>



<li>The <strong>Committee of Seventy</strong> leading volunteers assembling Civic Engagement Starter Kits: Understanding How Philly Works, a hands-on project designed to provide accessible, actionable tools for understanding and navigating Philadelphia’s government. These kits are part of a broader effort to expand the reach of the How Philly Works brand as a trusted resource for civic education.</li>



<li>A <strong>Rally for Peace &amp; Justice</strong> will focus on the history of Girard College and civil rights activism, with music and cultural presentations, organized by the Cecil B. Moore Philadelphia Freedom Fighters, the organization which led efforts to desegregate Girard College in the 1960’s.</li>



<li>A Health &amp; Wellness Fair, led by the <strong>Black Doctors Consortium</strong>, will include professionals providing information and guidance on community health services, including behavioral health.</li>
</ul>

								<excerpt><![CDATA[Trump's pick to lead the Defense Department received a friendly response from Republicans as Democrats questioned his past remarks and character.]]></excerpt>
								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p>Pete Hegseth was met with a friendly reception from Senate Republicans at <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/pete-hegseth-senate-confirmation-hearing-trump-defense-secretary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his hearing Tuesday before the Armed Services Committee</a>, who signaled they would get behind <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/trump-administration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President-elect Donald Trump’s embattled nominee</a> to be secretary of defense.</p>



<p>Hegseth came into the hearing with a cloud of controversies hanging over his nomination, including allegations of excessive drinking and sexual assault, which he has denied, and past remarks that women shouldn’t serve in combat, which he has since walked back.</p>



<p>But after he was questioned for more than four hours Tuesday, Republicans came away feeling optimistic that the former Fox News host and Army combat veteran would be confirmed to lead the Pentagon. The GOP controls 53 Senate seats and will need 50 senators to secure his confirmation.</p>



<p>“He&nbsp;comported&nbsp;himself extremely well and made a strong argument for why he ought to be the next secretary of defense,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.</p>



<p>Here are the key takeaways from the first confirmation hearing for Trump&#8217;s incoming Cabinet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Joni Ernst, a key Republican vote, plays nice</strong></h2>



<p>As a combat veteran and sexual assault survivor, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, has long been seen as a linchpin of Hegseth’s path to 50 votes, as she has expressed concerns about him. On Tuesday, she did little to challenge Hegseth.</p>



<p>She began by noting their “very productive” and “very frank” conversations while submitting into the record a letter from a Hegseth supporter. She asked him a question about assuring that the Pentagon can pass an audit in the future. She asked if women should have “the opportunity to serve in combat roles,” to which Hegseth replied in the affirmative, “exactly the way you caveated it.” She asked if he’ll appoint a senior official dedicated to sexual assault prevention, to which he noted he had already promised that to her: “As we have discussed, yes I will,” he said.</p>



<div style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%" class="wp-block-embed is-type-video"><iframe class="wp-block-embed is-type-video" src="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/embedded-video/mmvo229253189741" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="yes"></iframe></div>



<p>Ernst, who faces re-election in 2026, has come under heavy pressure from Trump allies to get behind Hegseth after her initial skepticisms of his nomination came to light. Lately, she hasn’t shown much of an appetite lately to buck the president-elect.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Tim Kaine grills Hegseth on character</strong></h2>



<p>Perhaps the most aggressive line of questioning came from Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who raised Hegseth’s personal indiscretions to question his character and his commitment to his word.</p>



<p>“Can you so casually cheat on a second wife and cheat on the mother of a child who had been born two months before, and you tell us you were completely cleared?” Kaine asked him. “You cheated on the mother of that child less than two months after that daughter was born, didn’t you?”</p>



<div style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%" class="wp-block-embed is-type-video"><iframe class="wp-block-embed is-type-video" src="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/embedded-video/mmvo229253701859" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="yes"></iframe></div>



<p>Hegseth downplayed a settlement and payment to the woman who accused him of sexual assault, saying it was a result of a “nuisance lawsuit.” He didn’t deny the infidelity.</p>



<p>“You’ve taken an oath, like you would take an oath to be secretary of defense and all of your weddings to be faithful to your wife,” Kaine told him.</p>



<p>“I have failed in things in my life, and thankfully, I’m redeemed by my lord and savior, Jesus,” Hegseth replied.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Republicans jump to Hegseth’s defense</strong></h2>



<p>Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., took the mic after Kaine and jumped to Hegseth’s defense.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry for what has been happening to you,” an indignant Cramer told him.</p>



<p>He wasn’t the only one. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., also went after Kaine and other Hegseth critics on the panel.</p>



<p>“The senator from Virginia starts bringing up the fact that, what if you showed up drunk to your job? How many senators have showed up drunk to vote at night? Have any of you guys asked them to step down and resign for their job?” he said. “How many senators do you know have got a divorce before cheating on their wives? Did you ask them to step down?”</p>



<div style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%" class="wp-block-embed is-type-video"><iframe class="wp-block-embed is-type-video" src="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/embedded-video/mmvo229259845624" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="yes"></iframe></div>



<p>“We’ve all made mistakes. I’ve made mistakes,” Mullin said. “Jennifer, thank you for loving him through that mistake,” he said, referring to Hegseth’s wife, “because the only reason why I’m here and not in prison is because my wife loved me, too.”</p>



<p>The comments underscored how some Republicans have rallied around Hegseth after a bumpy start to the confirmation process.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Culture war rhetoric dominates</strong></h2>



<p>Throughout the hearing, Hegseth repeatedly lavished praise on Trump and criticized President Joe Biden’s administration, channeling the language of the MAGA movement. He inveighed against “left-wing woke universities” and attacked the “left-wing media in America,” calling himself the victim of a “smear campaign.”</p>



<p>“And what we knew is that it wasn’t about me, most of it was about President Donald Trump, who’s had to endure the very same thing for much longer amounts of time,” Hegseth said. “And he endured it in incredibly strong ways.”</p>



<p>When Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., pressed Hegseth on whether “there are some orders that can be given by the commander in chief that would violate the U.S. Constitution,” he deflected and repeatedly rejected the premise that Trump might do that.</p>



<p>“I understand. You’ve done your genuflecting to him,” Slotkin said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Democrats press Hegseth on women in combat</strong></h2>



<p>Multiple Democrats took aim at Hegseth’s past remarks that women shouldn’t serve in combat roles.</p>



<p>“It’s a silly thing to say,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said, calling it “beneath the position that you are aspiring to.”</p>



<p>“We have hundreds, hundreds of women who are currently in the infantry, lethal members of our military serving in the infantry,” she said. “But you degrade them. You say we need moms, but not in the military, especially in combat units.”</p>



<div style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%" class="wp-block-embed is-type-video"><iframe class="wp-block-embed is-type-video" src="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/embedded-video/mmvo229244485929" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="yes"></iframe></div>



<p>Hegseth has since softened his opposition to women serving in the military. He said his views, “recently and in the past, and from personal experience, have been” based on “instances where I’ve seen standards lowered.”</p>



<p>Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost her legs serving in combat after her helicopter was shot down in Iraq, also took exception to Hegseth&#8217;s past stances.</p>



<p>“You can’t seem to grasp that there is no U.S. military as we know it without the incredible women that we serve, women who earn their place in their units,” Duckworth said. “You have not earned your place as secretary of defense.”</p>

								<excerpt><![CDATA[After four decades as a train engineer, on Friday, Jan. 10, 2025, -- in an event that, she said, made her cry for days -- Jacqueline Pettyjohn, SEPTA's first female engineer, pulled in to Suburban Station for the last time.]]></excerpt>
								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p>Jacqueline Pettyjohn has been riding SEPTA&#8217;s rails throughout the region for the past four decades. </p>



<p>But, on Friday, Jan. 10, 2025, Pettyjohn &#8212; who holds the distinction of being SEPTA&#8217;s first ever female train engineer &#8212; pulled her railcars into Suburban Station for the last time.</p>



<p>At her last stop, Pettyjohn was met with cheers from friends, loved ones and many commuters who relied on her service for the past 40 years. </p>



<p>It was a final journey that, she said, had her tearing up for three days.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was shocked. I did not expect that,&#8221; said Pettyjohn. &#8220;When I went home, it just hit me. I cried Friday night, Saturday and Sunday, all day. I just couldn&#8217;t believe the outpour of love they had for me and I have the same for them.&#8221; </p>



<p>In a social media post, SEPTA officials said that Pettyjohn joined the team back in August of 1984 after answering an ad in the newspaper. </p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After 40 years <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SEPTA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SEPTA</a>’s first female train engineer &#8211; Jackie Pettyjohn aka First Lady of SEPTA &#8211; celebrated her last day yesterday. The crowd who came out to celebrate is evidence of the impact and inspiration she leaves behind. Congrats Jackie! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ISEPTAPHILLY?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ISEPTAPHILLY</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HowWeRoll?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HowWeRoll</a> <a href="https://t.co/uEJ21gaTcq">pic.twitter.com/uEJ21gaTcq</a></p>&mdash; ISEPTAPHILLY (@SEPTAPHILLY) <a href="https://twitter.com/SEPTAPHILLY/status/1878116608943477192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2025</a></blockquote> 



<p>According to SEPTA, Pettyjohn initially &#8220;had no intention of staying, but ended up falling in love with the job.&#8221; </p>



<p>After spending the past 40 years working as a train engineer for SEPTA, Pettyjohn said she still plans to stay on the move. </p>



<p>In retirement, she said, she plans to travel and spend more time with her family. </p>



<p>And, while SEPTA may be losing its first female engineer, Pettyjohn has been a trailblazer for others as, out of SEPTA&#8217;s 202 train engineers on staff, 35 of them, officials said, are female. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Following the deadly terrorist attack in New Orleans earlier this month, officials in Ocean City are reexamining safety measures to keep cars and trucks from driving onto the boards and other crowded areas. </p>



<p>When Ocean City Police Chief William Campbell saw the horrifying images from the attack, he told NBC10 that he immediately thought about the vulnerability of the residents in the popular Jersey Shore destination. </p>



<p>“Is the boardwalk a potential target?” William said.&#8221; It absolutely is. It&#8217;s a soft target.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On New Year&#8217;s Day, along crowded Bourbon Street, pedestrians were deliberately mowed down, and 14 people lost their lives. The rampage prompted Campbell and other officials to find better ways to safeguard the boardwalk, which also can be packed, especially during the summer &#8212; including Asbury Avenue in downtown Ocean City. </p>



<p>“We want to make sure there never is a threat for something like that to happen,&#8221; said Ocean City Council Member Jody Levchuck. </p>



<p>For years, the city has staggered police vehicles at certain boardwalk ramps to keep unauthorized traffic from driving up. But now, Campbell is considering blocking every access ramp with parked vehicles between 6th and 14th streets. There would still be enough room for bikers to ride on and off the boards. </p>



<p>“Everything&#8217;s on the table at this point,&#8221; Campbell added. </p>



<p>Ocean City native Adam Coste was among the dozens of people hurt in the New Orleans terror attack. The city&#8217;s mayor noted the local connection at last week’s council meeting.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our thoughts and prayers go out to Adam and his family. I hear he’s on the road to recovery,&#8221; Ocean City Mayor Jay Gillian had said. </p>



<p>“Whether you live in Ocean City or you&#8217;re here visiting. We have a responsibility as the police department to make it a safe environment,&#8221; Campbell said. </p>



<p>The chief hopes to have a finalized plan in place by the summer. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>As a police investigation into the death of a man, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/man-killed-woman-hit-septa-bus-queen-village-center-city-philadelphia/4068339/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/man-killed-woman-hit-septa-bus-queen-village-center-city-philadelphia/4068339/" target="_blank">who was struck and killed by a SEPTA bus on Jan. 3, 2025</a>, continues members of the victim&#8217;s family are seeking answers and looking for assurance that no other family will need to suffer in the way they have.</p>



<p>During a memorial event for Michael Spooner, held Monday, Jordan Strokovsky, an attorney for Spooner family, said that Spooner&#8217;s loved ones are still seeking answers in the 35-year-old&#8217;s untimely death.</p>



<p>&#8220;What have you been doing to make sure that innocent pedestrians are not getting killed by SEPTA buses and they want to what SEPTA is going to do to make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen to a family again,&#8221; asked Strokovsky. </p>



<p>In a statement, SEPTA officials said they were cooperating with an ongoing police investigation into the incident that left Spooner dead and the mass transit provider was also &#8220;conducting its own examination of the incident,&#8221; as well. </p>



<p>&#8220;Our hearts go out to everyone who is impacted by this tragic incident. SEPTA is fully cooperating with Philadelphia Police in the accident investigation. SEPTA’s System Safety Division is also conducting its own examination of the incident,&#8221; SEPTA said in a statement shared by a spokesperson. &#8220;The safety of the riders and communities we serve is our top priority. We are committed to full transparency with the public as we learn more from the System Safety investigation.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to police, Spooner was killed in an incident that happened at about 7 p.m. at the intersection of Front Street and Washington Avenue in South Philadelphia on Jan. 3, 2025.</p>



<p>At that time, officials said, Spooner and his wife were crossing the roadway in the crosswalk when they were struck by a Route 64 SEPTA bus that was being driven by a 50-year-old man. </p>



<p>The bus was making a turn and struck the pain, injuring Spooner&#8217;s wife and trapping him under the vehicle. </p>



<p>Spooner, officials said, was pronounced at the scene. </p>



<p>Police officials said an investigation into this crash is ongoing.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The mother of <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/man-killed-by-fbi-connected-to-7-eleven-robberies/3620016/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/man-killed-by-fbi-connected-to-7-eleven-robberies/3620016/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a man who was shot and killed by members of the FBI</a> in August of 2023,  as he was being sought for his suspected connection to a string of convenience store robberies, has brought forward a lawsuit following her son&#8217;s slaying. </p>



<p>Over the past weekend, Stacey Weeks, mother of 22-year-old Taheim Weeks-Cook, filed a lawsuit against the United States government and the FBI agents involved in the Aug. 4, 2023, shooting that lead to her son&#8217;s death. </p>



<p>In a court document, Weeks argues that the FBI agents used excessive force in attempting to apprehend her son. </p>



<p>She also claims, in court documents, that agents failed to surround the Nicetown property where they attempted to apprehend Weeks-Cook, failed to knock to announce their arrival and that agents shot and killed an unarmed Weeks-Cook, knowing he had no weapon in his possession. </p>







<p>On the day he was killed, FBI agents descended on a home along the 1700 block of West Venango Street where Weeks-Cook was located. Court documents note that, when law enforcement officials arrived, Weeks-Cook exited the property and attempted to flee, dropping a cell phone he was carrying.</p>



<p>&#8220;After dropping his cell phone Plaintiff’s Decedent’s hands were visibly empty,&#8221; the lawsuit claims. </p>



<p>FBI agents dressed in military gear, court documents claims, pursued Weeks-Cook, while other agents followed him in unmarked vans. </p>



<p>Eventually, one van stopped along the sidewalk where Weeks-Cook was running and, court documents claim, he approached the van with empty hands.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s when, the lawsuit claims, Weeks-Cook was shot twice at point-blank range.</p>



<p>&#8220;As Plaintiff’s Decedent moved closer to the dark-colored FBI van, Defendant FBI Agent John Doe I intentionally and/or using excessive force, shot Plaintiff’s Decedent twice at point-blank range while Defendant John Doe I was still inside the dark-colored undercover FBI van and Plaintiff’s Decedent was outside the van, unarmed and his hands visibly empty,&#8221; notes the court document.</p>



<p>Two days after the shooting, Weeks-Cook died while in the hospital. </p>



<p>According to police, Weeks-Cook had been sought after <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/fbi-wanted-string-of-robberies-pennsylvania/3615266/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/fbi-wanted-string-of-robberies-pennsylvania/3615266/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a string of armed robberies happened at convenience stores</a> in the Philadelphia suburbs throughout the month of July in 2023. </p>



<p>Law enforcement officials have said that Weeks-Cook was sought for his suspected involvement in at least one of those armed robberies. </p>



<p>According to the court documents, Cook is seeking compensation and punitive damages in relation to her son&#8217;s slaying. </p>



<p>Contacted by NBC10, an FBI spokesperson said the agency had no comment on the lawsuit. </p>

<p>Tralee Hale-Ringo, the mother of Eagles cornerback Kelee Ringo, told NBC10 she was with her 10-year-old Shih Tzu named Molly inside the Target store on 2701 Castor Avenue back on Monday, Oct. 28, around 9 p.m. when she had to go to the bathroom.</p>



<p>“I usually put her in the cart when I go and walk around the store but this particular day, we were just walking in, I was working with her, she does stay right by my heel,&#8221; Hale-Ringo said. &#8220;She’s smarter than she is cute and I just got in the door and then quick had to use the restroom. Again, it’s never happened before.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Hale-Ringo stepped out of the bathroom, her dog was gone.</p>

<p>Hale-Ringo said Molly helped her get through her battle with breast cancer. She also told NBC10 the dog was dressed in a costume at the time of the theft.</p>



<p>“She had on her blue and white dress. She has her nails done. She wears jewelry. She has a pink top knot dyed and a pink tail for breast cancer awareness and she has just been by my side for the past ten years,” she said.</p>



<p>Hale-Ringo told NBC10 that after the surveillance video surfaced, someone recognized Molly at a New Jersey Wawa and contacted police.</p>



<p>“That just started the ball rolling on that direction there where there were really accurate, credible leads that came through right away as soon as it made the news the first time,” she said.</p>

<p>Finally, on Monday, Jan. 13, two and a half months after the theft, Hale-Ringo was reunited with her beloved Molly. The reunion came just in time for the Eagles playoff run. Hale-Ringo hopes the good news brings good luck to her son and his team.</p>



<p>“We got a win yesterday and a win for me two days in a row,” she said. “Go Birds.”</p>



<p>Police have not yet revealed where in New Jersey Molly was found or if anyone was arrested and charged in connection to her initial theft. NBC10 reached out to Philadelphia police for comment. We have not yet heard back from them. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Federal money is helping a Delaware city make it easier to charge electric cars and bicycles while out and about.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025, <a href="https://newarkde.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1487" data-type="link" data-id="https://newarkde.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1487">Newark, Delaware, announced</a> a $590,949 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/grant-toolkit/charging-and-fueling-infrastructure-grant-program" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/grant-toolkit/charging-and-fueling-infrastructure-grant-program" target="_blank">Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) program</a> grant to build chargers for e-bikes and electric cars.</p>



<p>&#8220;This funding will enable the installation of 11 dual-port electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and 12 e-bike charging stations, significantly advancing Newark’s commitment to sustainability and enhancing access to green transportation options,&#8221; the <a href="https://newarkde.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1487" data-type="link" data-id="https://newarkde.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1487">New Castle County city said in a new release</a>. </p>



<p>Right now, the college town has only five public EV car chargers and none catering to e-bike charging, Newark officials said.</p>



<p>&#8220;This project will more than triple the City’s EV charging capacity while introducing e-bike charging infrastructure for the first time, ensuring residents and visitors have access to modern, sustainable transportation resources,&#8221; Newark said.</p>



<p>In total, the up to 17 new EV charging stations could be added thanks to the grant, Newark officials said. </p>



<p>&#8220;The new charging stations will be strategically located at downtown municipal lots, Curtis Mill Park, Phillips Park, and the George Wilson Center,&#8221; Newark said. &#8220;As a contingency, the Newark Reservoir/Preston’s Playground has been identified as a backup location should any of the primary sites prove infeasible.&#8221;</p>



<p>The city would be able to add stations over time should demand rise.</p>



<p>No other Delaware city has received funding in the first three rounds of CFI grants, Newark said. Having the University of Delaware helped close the deal.</p>



<p>&#8220;This award reflects a strong partnership between the University and City for the betterment of our community,  combining expertise from different disciplines to create more equitable access to charging infrastructure in Newark,&#8221; Assistant City Manager Jeff Martindale said. &#8220;This collaboration is a testament to Newark’s innovative and inclusive approach to addressing Newark’s needs.&#8221;</p>



<p>The ultimate goal of the charging stations is to lessen emissions, city leaders said.</p>



<p>“Expanding EV and e-bike charging options is a critical step toward achieving the conservation goals outlined in the City’s Community Sustainability Plan,” Martindale said. “This grant will help Newark reduce emissions and promote cleaner, greener transportation options for residents and visitors alike.&#8221;</p>



<p>NBC10 has reached out to Newark officials to find out how much it will cost to charge vehicles at the new charging stations. We will update this story with that answer.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Police are investigating a case, they believe, involves a man who was shot by his girlfriend&#8217;s ex-boyfriend, in North Philadelphia early Tuesday. </p>



<p>According to police, in an incident that happened at a home along the 4600 block of Palethorp Street in North Philadelphia, before 6:30 a.m., a 28-year-old man, was shot in the back at least one time in front of the property. </p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/tiroteo-domestico-palethorp-street-filadelfia/2459726/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/tiroteo-domestico-palethorp-street-filadelfia/2459726/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Léelo en español aquí.</a></em></p>



<p>Officials said that, through initial investigation, officials believe the man was targeted by his girlfriend&#8217;s ex-boyfriend, who a police source told NBC10, pulled up at the scene in a vehicle, produced a firearm and opened fire.</p>



<p>Police have recovered a weapon and, officials said, they believe at least 16 shots were fired in this incident. </p>



<blockquote class="featured-text">

<p>The injured man, police officials said, was taken to a nearby hospital after the incident and, as of Tuesday afternoon, he was listed in stable condition.</p>



<p>Police did not say if they have apprehended the individual believed responsible for this incident, nor did they provide information as to why they believe the ex-boyfriend of the victim&#8217;s girlfriend is suspected to be involved.</p>



<p>But, police officials did say an investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>After a surprise change of heart Sunday found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/officials-sixers-abandon-center-city-plan-will-stay-in-south-philly/4075455/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/officials-sixers-abandon-center-city-plan-will-stay-in-south-philly/4075455/" target="_blank">planners behind a $1.3 billion new Center City arena project for the Philadelphia 76ers throwing the project away</a>, officials with the city and Philly&#8217;s sports teams, gathered to discuss what happened and what comes next. </p>



<p>On Monday, Jan. 13, 2025, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker joined City Council President Kenyatta Johnson, Sixers’ owner Josh Harris, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts and other business and sports leaders to discuss the Sixers decision to throw out years of planning and discussion on the arena proposal that dates back to 2022 and, instead, back a plan for a new arena for the Sixers and Flyers in the city&#8217;s South Philly stadium complex.</p>



<p>“This is about a win, win, win, win for Philadelphia here on today,” Parker said as she was surrounded by officials at City Hall. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Officials celebrate ‘exciting’ partnership for new arena</h2>



<p>In a release shared by organizers ahead of the day&#8217;s event, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.hbse.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.hbse.com/" target="_blank">Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment</a> &#8212; which owns the Sixers &#8212; announced that it has entered a &#8220;binding agreement&#8221; with <a href="https://comcastspectacor.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://comcastspectacor.com/">Comcast Spectacor</a> to bring a &#8220;world-class, state-of-the-art arena&#8221; to the South Philadelphia sports complex that would serve as a new home for the basketball team and the Philadelphia Flyers. </p>



<p>In addressing the switch from an approved plan for Center City to this partnership for a new stadium in South Philly, 76ers&nbsp;co-owner&nbsp;David Adelman noted that there could be some confusion swirling about the move. </p>



<p>But, he said, this decision will result in a world-class arena for the sports teams and would still provide revitalization efforts for the city&#8217;s Market East community.</p>



<p>“Though plans have changed, the one thing that has not changed is our commitment to do something good for the Sixers, our fans and, most importantly, our city,&#8221; said Adelman. </p>



<p>The statement also claims that Comcast will take a minority stake in the 76ers and will join with Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment &#8220;to bid to bring a WNBA team to the city.&#8221; </p>



<p>The chance at the city getting a WNBA franchise was one of the goals that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver &#8212; attending via video-link &#8212; said was one of Parker&#8217;s goals when he spoke with her in July of last year.</p>

<p>And, he said, the &#8220;exciting&#8221; partnership between the Sixers and Comcast could help forward that effort. </p>



<p>&#8220;This new collaboration will result in real tangible benefits for the people of Philadelphia” Silver said. </p>



<p>Until recently, Josh Harris, co-owner of the Sixers, said that the team had planned on “going a different direction.&#8221; But, he said that, over the last two weeks talking with Comcast, they decided to work together on two projects instead of one: a new home for the Sixers and Flyers and a venue for concerts and events in South Philly and an effort to revitalize Market East.</p>



<p>“The journey to the best solution doesn’t always go in a straight line,” said Harris. “But, I am certain that today we have found an incredibly positive solution for Philly.”</p>

<p>In discussing this partnership, Brian Roberts, the chairman and CEO of Comcast, said Philadelphia is home and that, as this situation unraveled, he wanted to put the city first.</p>



<p>“We wanted to imagine our city with a vibrancy with economic development and with vision,” he said.</p>



<p>Also, officials acknowledged the desire to bring a WNBA franchise to the city and, on hand to discuss the idea, comedian and fan of the WNBA, Wanda Sykes, said that she is helping make it a reality. </p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think our odds could be anymore favorable than they are today,&#8221; Sykes said. </p>



<p>She also squeezed in a special &#8220;Go Birds,&#8221; in her comments, as well, with an apology to Harris who owns the Philadelphia Eagles&#8217; rival Washington Commanders.</p>







<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">The long, winding road to a new South Philly arena plan</h2>



<p>Parker also addressed the &#8220;curveball that none of us saw coming&#8221; &#8212; the new new plan.</p>



<p>She had long supported the plan to bring the proposed arena, 76 Place, to the area of the intersection of Market and Filbert streets at 10th and 11th streets, even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/mayor-cherelle-parker-philadelphia-76ers-center-city-market-east/3979938/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/mayor-cherelle-parker-philadelphia-76ers-center-city-market-east/3979938/" target="_blank">touting the proposed plans as &#8220;a historic agreement&#8221;</a> before heading on a citywide tour to talk to communities across Philadelphia about the proposal late last year. </p>

<p>City councilmembers seemingly took more convincing, holding a wealth of hearings on the proposal over several weeks last year, before eventually, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/city-council-to-hold-final-vote-on-1-3b-76ers-center-city-arena-plan/4058338/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/city-council-to-hold-final-vote-on-1-3b-76ers-center-city-arena-plan/4058338/" target="_blank">approving the plan on Dec. 19, 2024</a> by an overwhelming majority.</p>



<p>Also, over the course of last year, New Jersey officials courted the Sixers ownership, trying to get them to bring the team to Camden &#8212; even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nba/philadelphia-76ers/philadelphia-76ers-sixers-nj-camden-proposal-tax-incentives-400-million-chinatown-center-city/3958891/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nba/philadelphia-76ers/philadelphia-76ers-sixers-nj-camden-proposal-tax-incentives-400-million-chinatown-center-city/3958891/" target="_blank">offering up to $400 million in tax credits</a> to help sway the team out of Philly. </p>

<p>Yet, in the end, as confirmed over the weekend, the team worked out a new deal with Comcast Spectacor that would see the Wells Fargo Center demolished and a new arena built in South Philadelphia for the Sixers and Flyers.</p>



<p>Parker said she approved of the original proposal, and she still feels it would have been a historic deal.</p>



<p>This new plan, however, could be bigger, better and could get done faster, the first-term Democrat said.</p>



<p>Parker noted that the change means that the city lost a $60 million community benefits agreement and a $1.3 billion private investment into Center City with the loss of the approved arena project for Market East. </p>



<p>But, &#8220;now we are here,&#8221; she said, saying there will still be a revitalization of Market East and the Sixers will still stay in Philadelphia. </p>



<p>She also said the city would still honor a $20 million commitment to invest in affordable housing and other projects in the city&#8217;s Chinatown neighborhood. </p>



<p>&#8220;This opportunity is packed with potential,&#8221; Parker said. </p>



<p>Philadelphia City Council president Kenyatta Johnson agreed, noting that he’s been working with the organizations involved all throughout the legislative process and said that the day’s announcement meant the city may be losing the Center City proposal, but it would gain a new arena as well as a revitalization effort.</p>



<p>“This is a win-win because Plan B is better than Plan A,&#8221; said Johnson.</p>



<p>Though, any details on what this new arena may cost, just where it would be constructed, if it would be built with taxpayer funds, when construction would begin and when the Wells Fargo Center could come down, have all not yet been made public. </p>



<p>And, Parker said, nothing would be released until the city had done &#8220;the same amount of homework&#8221; with the new project that officials did for the abandoned Center City arena plan.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing that we did is going to be in vain,&#8221; said Parker. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DExVa-9OUCr/?hl=en" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/DExVa-9OUCr/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joint post on social media</a>, the Sixers did hint that they plan to create a new &#8220;world-class arena&#8221; in partnership with the Flyers by 2031.</p>







<p>As for the now abandoned Center City arena plan, it was also set to open in 2031.</p>



<p>Comcast is the parent company of NBC10 and NBC Universal.</p>

<p>Ever dreamed about having an entire zoo to yourself? Well, now you can, thanks to <a href="https://www.philadelphiazoo.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.philadelphiazoo.org/">Philadelphia Zoo</a>&#8216;s new program, “Key to the Zoo: Premium Insider Tours.&#8221; </p>



<p>During the month of January, while the zoo is in &#8220;hibernation&#8221; mode and closed to the public, you have a chance to visit and have all 42 acres to yourself while zoo experts take you behind the scenes to learn about the zoo&#8217;s animals, history, and conservation work. </p>



<p>You have the option to pick from two unique new tour options: Conservation in Action and History at America&#8217;s First Zoo. </p>



<p>The first tour &#8212; Conservation in Action  &#8212; will include a behind-the-scenes experience where you can get up close and personal with the animals and learn about their individual personalities from the keepers themselves. Tickets will also include lunch with a Zoo&#8217;s Animal Care Team member to discuss their experiences saving wildlife worldwide. You will even receive a one-of-a-kind gift created by one of the animals. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A fighter on and off the court, a New Jersey high school basketball star is battling more than just his opponents — and continues to defy the odds.</p>



<p>In 2024, Ridgewood High School senior Johnny Jackson was diagnosed with cancer. Many people thought the news would sideline him for the season. But he has simply refused to back down or let cancer shape his world.</p>



<p>&#8220;This chemotherapy, it&#8217;s really vicious, I have nerve pain all over my body right now,&#8221; Jackson told NBC New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s just so brutal, it&#8217;ll knock me out for a few days.&#8221;</p>



<p>The 18-year-old star for the Ridgewood Maroons has endured double digit chemotherapy treatments for stage 4B Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma since summer 2024. </p>



<p>&#8220;Been a lot of health struggles, there&#8217;s been a lot of ups and down, but just making it this far to this point, it just feels great to be here right now,&#8221; Jackson said.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is the one thing that means the world to him, is playing basketball. Cancer took a lot from him but it&#8217;s not going to take this,&#8221; said his mother, Lynsey Jackson.</p>



<p>His sister shared a similar sentiment, saying her brother &#8220;truly has a different mindset compared to everyone else.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a junior last season, Jackson played the entire year at 50%. He still averaged 22 points per game. But his weight dropped from 170 pounds down to 152. </p>



<p>His dad, Joe, and mom were searching for answers. In July, they finally got one: Their son was diagnosed with cancer. He started treatment in August. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a competitor&#8230;so I kind of just faced it like a game, and I was kind of up for the challenge from day 1. I knew I was going to take it down,&#8221; said Jackson.</p>



<p>Ten chemo session ensued from Aug. 12 to Dec. 19, the night of Ridgewood&#8217;s season opener. Jackson vowed to play — it was his goal, it was his dream. </p>



<p>And he delivered. Jackson scored 30 points in a victory over St. Joe&#8217;s of Montvale.</p>



<p>When asked how he went from a chemo session on Monday, to dropping 30 just three days later, Jackson said he didn&#8217;t have an answer.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just went out there and did it,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The story has been embraced by the entire Ridgewood community. His coach and teammates have been in awe of his strength and nobility. His coach, Mike Troy, called it &#8220;an individual story that people wouldn&#8217;t believe if it was in a movie.&#8221;</p>



<p>This season, Jackson has been a profile in heart, courage and inspiration has been averaging 25 points per game. He hopes to soon be cancer-free. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just going to try to inspire as many kids as possible and honestly just put it in the past as quick as I can because it&#8217;s been a very troublesome journey,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>On Monday, Jackson had his 12th and final chemotherapy treatment at the Joseph Sanzari Children&#8217;s Hospital at Hackensack University Medical Center. A celebration ensued moments later, as his entire basketball team and family surprised him in the hallway of the hospital — with hugs and kisses, smiles and tears, and plenty of gratitude.</p>



<p>Jackson must still get a PET scan in mid-February before he can be declared officially cancer-free. Until then, he will continue his pursuit of 2,000 career points. As of Monday, he was 285 points away.</p>



<p>The team is still chasing a state championship. The Maroons won nine of their first 10 games, and were one of the best teams in New Jersey.</p>

<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">
<p>After <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/nfl-wild-card-aj-brown-reading-sideline-amazon-book-best-seller-reviews/4076541/" target="_blank">A.J. Brown helped his book reach No. 1 on Amazon’s best sellers list</a>, “Inner Excellence” author Jim Murphy spoke with NBC10 about how it came to be and how it caught the attention of the Eagles superstar in the first place.</p>



<p>In an interview with NBC10&#8217;s Frances Wang Monday night, Murphy said “Inner Excellence” was inspired by his own personal journey after getting rid of over half of his possessions.</p>
</div>





<p>“Two and a half years in the desert. First New Year’s I went to live a life of solitude and my first New Year’s I didn’t know what day it was. I hear noise. I’m in my room alone and empty house on New Year’s Eve journaling. I hear a noise, I go outside and I see fireworks,” Murphy said. “And that’s when I found out it was December 31. And so, it was a very solitary, lonely time and five years of working on it, I spent my life savings and was $90,000 in debt. And I didn’t know if anyone besides my mom would ever read it. So, it was lonely, scary. Yeah.”</p>



<p>Murphy said that fear helped him develop the book’s main theme. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“The thesis for ‘Inner Excellence’ is that self-centeredness is the greatest challenge that we face in performance and in life. It leads to fear. And selflessness is fearless,” he said. “The essence of ‘Inner Excellence’ is how do you develop the habits every day of thought and action around the person that you want to become and what’s most important to you and how can you be fully engaged, heart, mind and body, in the moment and unattached to your results that are always temporary and always in the past and future.”</p>



<p>Murphy said his book eventually caught the attention of DJ Giaritelli, a theological consultant with ties to the University of Texas at Austin, where Eagles defensive tackle Moro Ojomo played college football. </p>



<p>“He gave the book to Moro Ojomo. And Moro went to the Eagles and Moro gave it to A.J.,” Murphy said.</p>



<p>Murphy said that even before Sunday’s wild card game against the Packers, he was aware that A.J. Brown was reading his book.</p>



<p>“I knew that he was reading the book and he had the book,” Murphy said. “I saw it on the sideline recently so I thought, ‘Oh, that’s really cool.’ I didn’t know he was bringing it to every game and reading it after every drive. So that’s really neat.”</p>



<p>Eagles fans everywhere watched as Brown was captured on camera during Sunday&#8217;s game reading the book. After the game, while in the locker room, Brown said the book gives him <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/aj-brown-reading-packers-playoff-game-inner-excellence/641990/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/aj-brown-reading-packers-playoff-game-inner-excellence/641990/" target="_blank">a “sense of peace.”</a> That inspired Eagles fans to find the book on Amazon and flood it with five-star reviews, catapulting it to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/INNER-EXCELLENCE-Extraordinary-Performance-Possible/dp/1734654805/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.amazon.com/INNER-EXCELLENCE-Extraordinary-Performance-Possible/dp/1734654805/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" target="_blank">No. 1 on the best sellers list</a>.</p>



<p>“I’m super excited for the Eagles fans to get it and for people all around America to learn the same things that I’m working on, he’s working on,” Murphy said. </p>



<p>Murphy told NBC10 he was an Eagles fan even before Brown helped his book reach new heights.</p>



<p>“I am an Eagles fan. For sure. What’s interesting is I have a connection to Philadelphia now in the last year that I didn’t have before. A group of Penn State wrestling alumni reached out to me,” Murphy said. “They’re building a multimillion-dollar leadership training center in Lititz, it’s an hour and a half west of Philly and they want to use “Inner Excellence” as their leadership training program. And asked if I would be interested and I said, not only would I be interested but I’d be interested in making it an “Inner Excellence” headquarters. And so I could be in Philly quite a bit going forward.”</p>



<p>Murphy also has a new book he just finished in November of last year. It’s called “The Best Possible Life.”</p>



<p>“It’s like a summary of ‘Inner Excellence’ which is based on the Bible,” Murphy said.</p>



<p>Eagles fans are certainly living their best possible life as the Birds continue to tap into their inner excellence during their playoff run. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A gas main break blocked lanes on a stretch of a busy South Jersey road Tuesday morning.</p>



<p>The repairs caused all lanes of Route 42 (Black Horse Pike) north of Greentree Road (County Route 651) in Washington Township, New Jersey, to be closed for hours, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://511nj.org/event/ORI1237770616?8896=" data-type="link" data-id="https://511nj.org/home" target="_blank">according to 511NJ</a>. </p>



<p>The incident began shortly before 1 a.m. on Jan. 14, 2025. It remained an issue as the morning rush began.</p>



<p>One northbound lane was able to get by around 5 a.m. Then around 6:30 a.m., all northbound lanes were open and one southbound lane was able to get by, <a href="https://x.com/511nj42/status/1879128357880639796" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/511nj42/status/1879128357880639796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">511NJ said</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gas main break on NJ 42 both directions North of CR 651/Greentree Rd (Washington Twp) All lanes open northbound; 1 Right lane of 2 lanes closed southbound <a href="https://t.co/l57IodS9XN">https://t.co/l57IodS9XN</a></p>&mdash; 511NJ NJ42 (@511nj42) <a href="https://twitter.com/511nj42/status/1879128357880639796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote> 



<p>Expect traffic to be a problem as more people hit the road Tuesday morning.</p>



<p>NBC10 First Alert Traffic reporter Sheila Watko suggested using the Atlantic City Expressway or Egg Harbor Road to avoid the closure entirely. Drivers could also detour through parking lots to get around the southbound closure.</p>



<p>No word on when the road will fully reopen.</p>

<p>New year, new you.</p>



<p>The new year always brings out personal goals and resolutions. Everything from getting in shape to, perhaps, learning a new instrument. While it is easy to make New Year’s resolutions, it can prove hard to keep them. However, it turns out there are cities that are better than others at keeping resolutions. </p>



<p>With this in mind, <a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/best-cities-for-new-years-resolutions/28749">WalletHub</a> looked at the cities that are the best &#8212; and worst &#8212; when it comes to keeping goals for 2025. To do so, the study compared 182 cities in the United States, looking at 57 metrics ranging from exercise opportunities to income growth to employment prospects.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/best-cities-for-new-years-resolutions/28749">WalletHub study determined</a> that Seattle is the best city when it comes to keeping resolutions. Seattle came in at No. 1 overall, thanks to how it ranked in specific categories: health resolutions rank (No. 5), financial resolutions rank (No. 4), school &amp; work resolutions rank (No. 92), bad-habit resolutions rank (No. 19), and relationship resolutions rank (No. 3).</p>



<p>But there is a city in the tri-state area that is on the opposite side of the ranking: Newark, New Jersey&#8217;s largest city, is the second worst city when it comes to keeping resolutions, <a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/best-cities-for-new-years-resolutions/28749">according to the ranking.</a>  Newark&#8217;s overall ranking (coming in at No. 181 out of 182 cities) is due to how it scored in the specific categories measured for the study. Newark came in as the 113rd city out of 182 when it comes to health resolutions rank; it came in last (182 out of 182) in the financial resolutions rank; it placed 181 out of 182 in the school &amp; work resolutions rank; 150 out of 182 in the bad-habit rank and 180 out of 182 cities in the relationship resolutions rank. </p>



<p>When it comes to specific categories, Newark is the city with the third highest percentage of adults not exercising. It also is the city with the second lowest median annual income (adjusted for cost of living). </p>



<p>Newark also has the second highest unemployment rate and it is the city with the third fewest parkland acres per capita.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s not all bad news for Newark. WalletHub found that the city is has the fifth lowest prevalence of adult binge drinking. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A 5-year-old boy is fighting for his life after the speeding vehicle he was in caused a chain-reaction crash in Northeast Philadelphia Monday night, police said. </p>



<p>Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Scott Small told NBC10 three vehicles &#8212; later identified as a Kia, Nissan and Range Rover &#8212; were stopped at a red light on Aramingo Avenue at Wakeling Street around 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 13, 2025. Suddenly a fourth vehicle &#8212; a Ford Taurus &#8212; that was speeding down Aramingo Avenue rear-ended at least one of the stopped cars, police crash investigators said. </p>



<p>A 5-year-old boy who was inside the Ford with his mother suffered severe head injuries. He was rushed to St. Christopher&#8217;s Hospital where he was listed &#8220;in very critical condition fighting for his life right now,&#8221; Small said after the crash.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hopefully he survives the injuries to his head,&#8221; Small said.</p>



<p>No one else who was inside the Kia, Nissan or Range Rover involved in the crash was seriously injured, Small said. That includes a 6-year-old girl who was shaken up, according to her father, but luckily not hurt.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very fortunate for the others that they were not injured,&#8221; Small said.</p>



<p>The striking Ford &#8212; which was being operated by the 5-year-old&#8217;s 30-year-old mother &#8212; struck with such force that one of the wheels came off of it, police said. Crash investigators preliminarily said that speed played a role in the crash.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clearly posted that the speed limit is 30 mph, but crash investigators preliminarily believe that speed was a factor,&#8221; Small said. &#8220;The striking vehicle, they believe, was traveling at a high-rate of speed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Surveillance video obtained by NBC10 shows cars crashing into frame, leaving a trail of debris on the road.</p>



<p>No arrests have been made though police continued to investigate and interview the drivers and passengers involved in the crash, as well as witnesses. </p>

								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p>Another week, another rematch.</p>



<p>Seven days after beating the Packers for the second time this year, the Eagles have a rematch with the Rams in the NFC conference semifinal round.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Rams advanced to the second round of the NFC playoff bracket with a 27-9 win over the Vikings Monday night. The game was played at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz, instead of SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., because of fires in the L.A. area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eagles-Rams kickoff is scheduled for 3 p.m. Sunday, with the winner advancing to the NFC Championship Game.</p>



<p>The Eagles beat the Rams 37-20 in late November at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The Rams went 10-7 and won the NFC South, earning the No. 4 seed as the division winner with the 4th-best record.</p>



<p>Saquon Barkley rushed for a franchise-record 255 yards with two touchdowns in the first meeting, A.J. Brown had 109 yards and a touchdown and the Eagles outgained the Rams by 191 yards (481-290).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the Rams, Matt Stafford passed for 243 yards with touchdown passes to Cooper Kupp and Robinson. Puka Nacua had 9-for-117 and Kyren Williams rushed for 72 yards and a TD on 16 carries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the Rams’ sixth trip to the playoffs in eight years under head coach Sean McVay. The Rams won Super Bowl LVI 23-20 over the Bengals at SoFi Stadium after the 2021 season.</p>



<p>For the second week in a row, the Eagles will be facing one of the LaFleur brothers. Packers head coach Matt LaFleur’s younger brother is Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Eagles and Rams have met three times in the postseason. In 1949, the Eagles beat the Rams 14-0 at L.A. Coliseum to win their second straight NFL Championship. In 1989, the Rams upset the Eagles 21-7 in a wild-card game at the Vet. And in 2001, the Rams beat the Eagles 29-24 at TWA Stadium in St. Louis in the NFC Championship Game.</p>



<p>It’s a tough ask for a West Coast team to play on a Monday night, get back to L.A. Tuesday morning, then travel to Philadelphia on Saturday for a game on Sunday. But the Rams are 17-9 playing in EST in seven years under McVay.</p>



<p>The Eagles are 24-20-1 all-time vs. the Rams but 15-5 since 1986 and 2-0 under Nick Sirianni.</p>



<p>The Rams are 10-17 all-time in road playoff games, including 3-2 under McVay. They’re 2-1 under McVay in the conference semifinal round, beating the Cowboys in 2018 in L.A., losing to the Packers in 2020 at Lambeau and beating the Bucs in Tampa in 2021.</p>



<p>The Eagles are 6-0 in franchise history in home games in the conference semifinal round, beating the Vikings in 1980, Falcons in 2002, Packers in 2003, Vikings in 2004, Falcons in 2017 and Giants in 2022. Including road games they’re 9-7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Rams are 12-9 in the conference semifinal round but 4-7 on the road, with those four wins coming in Dallas in 1976 and 1979, vs. the Giants in 1989 and in Tampa last year.</p>



<p>The Rams opened this season 1-4 and 5-6 before reeling off five straight wins, then losing the season finale at home vs. Seattle while resting most of their starters.</p>



<p>Stafford is 4-3 in his career vs. the Eagles &#8211; 4-1 with the Lions, 0-2 with the Rams &#8211; with 14 touchdowns and one interception &#8211; that was in 2012 by Nnamdi Asomugha.</p>



<p>Stafford has no shortage of weapons. Williams ran for 1,299 yards and 14 touchdowns with a 4.1 average, Nakua caught 79 passes for 990 yards in 11 games and Cupp was 67-for-710 with six TDs in 12 games.</p>



<p>The Rams finished 15th in the NFL with 331 yards per game and 20th with 21.6 points per game and 26th defensively with 353 yards allowed and 17th with 22.7 points allowed.</p>



<p>On Monday night in Glendale, the Rams only netted 292 yards of offense, but their defense recorded nine sacks &#8211; tying&nbsp; the NFL postseason record &#8211; along with 12 quarterback hits, 10 tackles for loss and two takeaways.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A New Jersey woman is accused of sexually abusing an underage teen boy and sending him nude photos of herself on social media over a three-month span. </p>



<p>The investigation began on May 1, 2024, when a New Jersey State Police trooper received a report accusing Tara Carr, 46, of Woodstown, of performing sexual acts on a teen boy who was between 13 and 16 years of age.</p>



<p>The trooper interviewed the boy and his parents who accused Carr of sexually assaulting the teen multiple times at Marlton Park in Pilesgrove, New Jersey, as well as a location in Mannington Township between March 2024 and May 2024.</p>



<p><strong><em><strong><em>Resources for victims of sexual assault are available through the National Sexual Violence Resources Center and the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at </em></strong><a href="tel:8006564673"><strong><em>800-656-4673</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></em></strong></p>



<p>The teen told investigators he had a sexual relationship with Carr who sent him sexually explicit messages and images on the social media app Snapchat, according to the affidavit of probable cause. Investigators said Carr also repeatedly picked the boy up from school and sexually assaulted him multiple times in her vehicle. </p>



<p>Carr admitted to sending sexually explicit images to the teen while being interviewed by investigators, according to the criminal complaint. Investigators also obtained Carr’s cellphone, searched her vehicle and accessed her Snapchat account which corroborated the teen’s accusations, officials said.</p>



<p>Carr was arrested on Jan. 9, 2025, in Salem County, New Jersey, and faces sexual assault charges. </p>



<p>Carr is scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2025, for a detention hearing. NBC10 reached out to New Jersey State Police to see if they are searching for more possible victims. We have not yet heard back from them.</p>



<p>Carr has ties to several businesses in the Deptford, New Jersey, area, including the Rastelli Kids Complex and South Jersey Storm All Star Cheerleading. A spokesperson for Carr’s family said she worked in management, did not interact with children involved with those businesses and has since relinquished her involvement. The spokesperson also said the victim was not involved with either business.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Rastelli Kids Complex also released the following statement: </p>



<p><strong><em>We want to reaffirm to the RKC community our commitment to creating a safe space for all of the&nbsp;kids and their families at Camp Sam, South Jersey Storm (SJS) and other&nbsp;programs.&nbsp;When these allegations came to light they were immediately reported it to the credentialing organizations for camp (American Camp Association (ACA) and cheer&nbsp; (USASF) notifying them as required.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>There were no charges filed against her when these allegations first came to light, and despite rumors, no previous charges were ever filed.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Moreover, the RKC management team had no knowledge of the extent of the allegations until the complaint, and neither owner has been questioned by the police concerning these allegations.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Since&nbsp;2007&nbsp;until these allegations,&nbsp;Tara Carr worked seasonally as part of a larger&nbsp;management team&nbsp;for Camp Sam.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At no time has Tara ever held a management position, coach position, or role other than parent in SJS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tara&#8217;s limited overall role&nbsp;with&nbsp;the RKC facility ended in May 2024 when she resigned and forfeited all ownership.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>To be clear, these allegations do not involve any employees, campers, athletes or members of our RKC community.&nbsp; The alleged victim in the charging&nbsp;document was not involved in any RKC program.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Our organization over the past 30 years has been dedicated to providing an atmosphere where our customers can strive for athletic and personal growth with the confident assistance from all of our staff members. We remain committed to complying with all the safety rules and the legal process.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>At this time, we have no further comment as we allow the authorities and legal system to complete their due process.&nbsp;We also ask those active on social media to consider the impact loose talk, gossip and chatter&nbsp;have on employees, customers and members of the RKC community &#8212; many of them children &#8212; who have done nothing wrong.</em></strong></p>

								<excerpt><![CDATA[With a simple sideline moment and the power of Eagles fans, there's a new No. 1 best seller on Amazon … and the reviews are absolutely hysterical.]]></excerpt>
								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p>The last thing on everyone&#8217;s bingo card for Eagles-Packers had to be A.J. Brown reading a book on the sideline and it becoming one of the hottest topics of the game.</p>



<p>… <em>Was that even on anyone&#8217;s bingo card?</em></p>



<p>During Sunday&#8217;s 22-10 win at Lincoln Financial Field, a FOX camera caught Brown reading his copy of &#8220;Inner Excellence&#8221; by Jim Murphy in between offensive series.</p>



<p>Following the victory in the locker room, Brown said that the <a href="https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/aj-brown-reading-packers-playoff-game-inner-excellence/641990/">book gives him a &#8220;sense of peace.&#8221;</a></p>



<p>Naturally, Eagles fans took to finding the book on Amazon, and after flooding it with five-star reviews, the book found itself at the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/INNER-EXCELLENCE-Extraordinary-Performance-Possible/dp/1734654805/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">No. 1 spot on the best sellers list</a>.</p>



<p>Now, lets focus on the reviews. Laugh out loud funny reviews that could&#8217;ve only been created by the best fans in the NFL.</p>



<p>(That&#8217;s completely unbiased, by the way.)</p>



<p>Hundreds have gone up in the last 24 hours and it doesn&#8217;t seem to be slowing down. Here&#8217;s the best of the bunch:</p>

<p>After hearing the high praise for this book from Brown and reading through the reviews, how could you not want to pick up a copy?</p>



<p>I know I did.</p>



<p>It will have a nice spot on my desk for the divisional game. You know, just in case I need to read something at halftime to bring me peace … or if I need to chuck something across the room.</p>



<p>Who knows — we all handle stress differently.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>This year, the runners who plan to participate in the upcoming Independence Blue Cross Broad Street Run will need to get ready to run little earlier &#8212; about a half-hour earlier, to be precise. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s because in its 46th year, the Independence Blue Cross Broad Street Run will have an earlier start time of 7 a.m. when it&#8217;s held on Sunday, May 4, 2025.</p>



<p>On Monday, Philadelphia Parks &amp; Recreation Commissioner Susan Slawson announced the earlier start time &#8212; in past years the run began at 7:30 a.m. &#8212; and said she was looking forward to this year&#8217;s event.</p>



<p>“I’m so excited to start the preparations for the Independence Blue Cross Broad Street Run,” said Slawson in a statement. “Whether participants are running for a cause or for themselves, come join us for this exhilarating 10-Miler through the heart of Philadelphia. It’s thrilling to see the runners participate in this Philly tradition, and watch the crowds cheer them on through the neighborhoods as they experience the sights and spirit of our vibrant city while running down Broad Street, passing by city landmarks, and receiving high-fives and hugs at the Navy Yard.”</p>



<p>In a statement, organizers said this year, the nation’s largest 10-mile road race will begin at Broad Street and Sommerville Avenue and finish in the Philadelphia Navy Yard.</p>



<p>“For many Philadelphians, today’s announcement of the Independence Blue Cross Broad Street Run is a signal to recommit to physical training, mental focus and good health,” said Gregory E. Deavens, president and CEO of Independence Blue Cross in a statement. “That is one reason we are proud to have sponsored this iconic springtime event for nearly three decades, and why we support other community fitness activities throughout the year, such as Indego bike share, our new annual pickleball tournament and the Independence Blue Cross River Rink.”</p>



<p>Registration for the 46th annual IBX Broad Street Run will open Feb.1, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. and close on Saturday, February 15, 2025, at 11:59 p.m. </p>



<p>The race will welcome up to 40,000 runners. </p>



<p>The race registration fee is $65. </p>



<p>Registrants will be accepted through a lottery system or have the option of running on behalf of a charity partner, such as the American Cancer Society, Students Run Philly Style, Back on My Feet and the Fairmount Park Conservancy, officials said in a statement. </p>



<p>Runners, organizers said, will be notified by email the week of Feb. 17, 2025 if they have secured a race bib.</p>



<p>The Independence Blue Cross Blue Cross Broad Street Run began in 1980 with 1,500 runners. </p>



<p>Last year, more than 31,400 runners completed the event and, organizers said that the Department of Parks and Recreation anticipates another sellout race.</p>

								<excerpt><![CDATA[Starting Monday, Jan. 13, 2025, four bridges -- Trenton-Morrisville (Route 1), I-78, Easton-Phillipsburg (Route 22), and Delaware Water Gap (I-80) -- are going cashless and will only offer E-ZPass or toll by plate payment.]]></excerpt>
								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p>After 87 years, Sunday, Jan. 12, 2025, marked the last day that the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission allowed drivers to use cash to pay for tolls. </p>



<p>Starting Monday, Jan. 13, 2025, the DRJTBC said it will only offer two payment options &#8212; E-ZPass and toll by plate &#8212; at its four high traffic volume bridges: Trenton-Morrisville (Route 1), I-78, Easton-Phillipsburg (Route 22), and Delaware Water Gap (I-80).</p>



<p>In a statement on the change, the DRJTBC said that &#8220;due to the inherently higher costs of billing and processing&#8221; toll by plate tolls will cost $3 while E-ZPass tolls over these same bridges costs $1.50. </p>



<p>&#8220;Once the last cash transaction is completed late Sunday night, the Commission will join the ranks of toll agencies nationally and around the world that have removed toll attendants from toll booths and completely converted to cashless all-electronic payment options that are safer, better for the environment, and less expensive to collect,&#8221; the DRJTBC said in a statement on the change. </p>



<p>The last cash tolls collected at these bridges, officials said, was at 11 p.m. on Sunday, Jan. 12, 2025. </p>



<p>Officials said motorist will likely notice that toll booths at these spans will no longer have attendants and there will be signage in place to remind drivers to keep moving instead of stopping for tolls. </p>



<p>The next step, officials with the DRJTBC said, would be the removal of barrier toll plaza and construction of highway-speed all-electronic tolling gantries at each toll bridge. This process is still in the design phase, officials said. </p>



<p>The New Hope-Lambertville (Route 202) Toll Bridge will be the first location to be shifted to open-road collections, a project slated for this year, officials said. </p>



<p>According to the DRJTBC, the current plan calls for hard conversions to be carried out at each of the Commission’s older toll bridges one at a time in each subsequent year, a process currently projected to be completed no later than 2032.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A 125-year-old golden crown was stolen from a statue of Mary inside a Philadelphia Catholic church by an agile thief seen climbing up the outside wall of the Center City church before breaking in, police said.</p>



<p>The theft occurred Saturday, Jan. 11, 2025, shortly after 1 a.m. inside the St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church on South 13<sup>th</sup> Street, Philadelphia police said.</p>



<p>Investigators said someone broke into the church by smashing through a stained-glass window. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfh5rLiqAS4" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfh5rLiqAS4">Surveillance video released by police Monday</a> shows the thief &#8212; his face covered while wearing a black jacket, gray pants and red or pink sneakers &#8212; scaling the outside of the historic church before getting inside.</p>



<p>Once inside, the burglar stole a golden crown from the head of the statue of Mary, police and church leaders said.</p>







<p>“Our video – we have outside and inside cameras – showed the guy coming in,” St. John’s Associate Pastor John McCloskey told NBC10. “And he was in and out within 10 minutes. He was very agile and he knew exactly what he was doing.”</p>



<p>The crown was made of jewelry and gems that were donated by parishioners following a fire at the church around 1900.</p>

<p>Hoda’s message was filled with words of wisdom for his first day in his new role.</p>



<p>“Craig-or!” Hoda said in a prerecorded message. “It’s your first day. How does it feel? First of all, I’m so proud of you, and I wanted to let you know just how proud of you I am, because, first of all, you’re going to be fantastic.”</p>



<p>Hoda said she would put the letter for Craig in “a secret hiding place” so he could open it on his first day as co-anchor. Savannah knew where the secret hiding spot was, according to Hoda. “So just ask her,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Go get ‘em, Craig. You’ve got this!” Hoda concluded.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What Hoda Kotb&#8217;s letter to Craig Melvin said</h2>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A historic bridge connecting a popular Bucks County town with New Jersey is showing its age and must close for needed repairs.</p>



<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.drjtbc.org/project/newhopelambertville" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.drjtbc.org/project/newhopelambertville" target="_blank">New Hope-Lambertville Toll-Supported Bridge</a> closed Monday, Jan. 13, 2025, for at least two weeks so that a rusted 120-year-old pin that supports the span over the Delaware River could be repaired, <a href="https://www.drjtbc.org/2024/11/two-week-shutdown-of-new-hope-lambertville-bridge-expected-to-begin-january-13/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.drjtbc.org/2024/11/two-week-shutdown-of-new-hope-lambertville-bridge-expected-to-begin-january-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission</a>, which operates the bridge.</p>



<p>The bridge could remained closed for up to two weeks, until Jan. 27, 2025, the DRJTBC said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The uninterrupted bridge closure will enable work crews and engineers to replace a deteriorated 4-inch-diameter, 18-inch-long steel pin that supports a critical joint of 11 structural steel members on the bridge’s second truss span from the Pennsylvania side,&#8221; the bridge commission said. &#8220;The 120-year-old pin has rusted and worn to the point where it poses a potential risk for failure under heavy load.&#8221;</p>



<p>The rusty issue was found by accident.</p>



<p>&#8220;The damaged pin was fortuitously discovered as a result of sand-blasting of the bridge’s painted surfaces last summer,&#8221; the DRJTBC said.</p>



<p>&#8220;This would mark the first time that a such pin replacement has been performed on the steel Pratt-truss bridge linking New Hope and Lambertville,&#8221; the commission added. &#8220;It also would mark the first time that such a repair procedure has been executed at any of the Commission’s bridges.&#8221;</p>



<p>The closure comes at an inopportune time for the shopping districts as <a href="https://www.visitnewhope.com/restaurant-week/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.visitnewhope.com/restaurant-week/">New Hope &amp; Lambertville Restaurant Week</a> 2025 takes place during the estimated closure time.</p>



<p>Folks going between the towns will need to take alternated routes to access businesses and restaurants. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.drjtbc.org/2024/11/two-week-shutdown-of-new-hope-lambertville-bridge-expected-to-begin-january-13/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.drjtbc.org/2024/11/two-week-shutdown-of-new-hope-lambertville-bridge-expected-to-begin-january-13/" target="_blank">The DRJTBC laid out detours</a> for folks looking to cross the river by car or foot:</p>



<p><em>As has been the case for the past 10 months, New Jersey-bound motorists will be detoured a mile north to the New Hope-Lambertville (Route 202) Toll Bridge, which does not have a toll in the New Jersey-bound direction.</em></p>



<p><em>Pennsylvania-bound motorists will have three options:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The closest alternate river crossing is the New Hope-Lambertville (Route 202) Toll Bridge, one mile north. This is tolled in the PA-bound direction. The Class 1 toll for personal vehicles (motorcycles, cars, pickups, vans, and SUVs up to 8-feet high with two axles) is $1.50 for E-ZPass and $3 for TOLL BY PLATE (an invoice sent in the mail to the vehicle’s registered owner).</em></li>



<li><em>The closest non-toll option is the Centre Bridge-Stockton Bridge, 3.3 miles north.</em></li>



<li><em>Downriver, the closest option is the Washington Crossing Bridge (narrow) 6.9 miles south.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em>For pedestrians, the Commission plans to provide a free shuttle service.  Currently, shuttle service is provided to complement the bridge’s temporary walkway on Friday nights and Saturdays and Sundays. The service will be expanded to a daily operation, but the hours have yet to be confirmed.</em></p>



<p>More details on getting around the bridge closure can be <a href="https://www.drjtbc.org/2024/11/two-week-shutdown-of-new-hope-lambertville-bridge-expected-to-begin-january-13/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.drjtbc.org/2024/11/two-week-shutdown-of-new-hope-lambertville-bridge-expected-to-begin-january-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found on the bridge commission&#8217;s website</a>.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Police have made an arrest after a woman was shot four times during an argument over loud music at a property in Philadelphia&#8217;s Frankford neighborhood early Monday, officials said. </p>



<p>According to police, the incident happened at about 1:30 a.m. on Monday, Jan. 13, 2025, as officers were called to a property along the 1800 block of Kinsey Street in Philadelphia&#8217;s Frankford section on a report of a shooting. </p>



<p>Here, according to Philadelphia Police Department Captain Andrew DiSanto, officers found a 31-year-old woman in the doorway on the first floor of a property after she had been shot four times.</p>



<p>In a morning update, officials said the woman was shot in her stomach, groin and left arm.</p>



<p>She was taken to a nearby hospital, where DiSanto said, she was immediately taken in for surgery. On Monday morning, officials said she was placed in stable condition. </p>



<p>However, he said, officers at the scene learned the individual suspected to have fired at the woman was still in the property on the second floor. </p>



<p>Police believe, DiSanto said, the shooting happened over the course of an argument about loud music and the suspected shooter, a 30-year-old man, fired down a stairwell in the property at the woman who was injured in this incident. </p>



<p>&#8220;It looks like an offender was on the second floor and did shoot down a stairwell and struck this female,&#8221; DiSanto said. </p>



<p>The man, DiSanto said, retreated into the building an a barricade was declared.</p>



<p>DiSanto said the property was a boarding house and, with the help of other residents, police were able to contact the suspected shooter through a telephone.</p>



<p>He eventually surrendered to police officials at about 2:50 a.m. without further incident and no other injures to anyone in the property, DiSanto said. </p>



<p>Police officials did not immediatley provide further information on the man who was taken into police custody in this incident, but DiSanto said, an investigation is ongoing. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Kohl’s said Friday it was closing 27 underperforming stores in 15 states by April — a fraction of its 1,150 store base — as the struggling department store aims to boost profitability and improve sagging sales.</p>



<p>Among those, one New Jersey location is set to close. The store on Princeton Hightstown Road in East Windsor was the only one in the tri-state area that is slated for closure.</p>



<p>The announcement comes as the Wisconsin-based chain has posted 11 consecutive quarters of sales declines and faces new leadership. Michaels CEO and retail veteran Ashley Buchanan will take over the chain&#8217;s top job, effective Wednesday, succeeding Tom Kingsbury, who will stay as an adviser to the new CEO and retain his position on Kohl’s board until his retirement this May. </p>



<p>Kingsbury served as Kohl’s interim CEO in December 2022 and was named its permanent leader in February 2023.</p>



<p>Kohl&#8217;s declined to disclose the number of employees affected. It said workers have been informed and have been offered a “competitive severance package” or the chance to apply to other open roles at Kohl’s. The list deemed for closing includes 10 in California.</p>



<p>“As we continue to build on our long-term growth strategy, it is important that we also take difficult but necessary actions to support the health and future of our business for our customers and our teams,&#8221; Kingsbury said in a statement.</p>



<p>On Thursday, Macy&#8217;s disclosed the locations of <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/business/macys-store-closing-list-near-me/6101815/">66 stores that it will be closing</a> early this year, including one in a historic landmark building in Philadelphia. The majority of these stores will close during the company&#8217;s first fiscal quarter of this year, Macy&#8217;s said.</p>



<p>Among the Macy&#8217;s stores closing in the New York City area, nine are in New York and one is in New Jersey.</p>



<p>The announcement is part of a strategy announced in February 2024, that calls for shuttering roughly 150 underproductive stores while upgrading its remaining 350 stores through fiscal 2026. The closings come as Macy&#8217;s is looking to improve its sales as shoppers have pulled back on discretionary items amid still high inflation.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Police officials in Delaware are investigating after two people were hurt on Monday morning when, officials said, their vehicle slammed into a church in Newark, Del.</p>



<p>According to police, officers responded to a car dealership located along the 300 block of East Cleveland Ave. after reports of suspicious activity involving a black sedan and people in the area on foot. </p>



<p>Responding officers, officials said in a Monday update, that officers arriving at the dealership saw a black sedan pull out of the property and onto E. Cleveland Avenue. As the officers tried to conduct a stop of that vehicle, officials said, the driver fled a traffic stop and continued westbound as police called off attempts to stop it. </p>



<p>However, as officers returned to the dealership and continued to look around the area for the vehicle, police officials said, they learned the vehicle they were looking for crashed into St. John AUMP Church, along New London Road in Newark, Del. </p>



<p>At that time, officials said, first responders arrived to find a single vehicle crashed against the side of the church, causing a partial collapse of the structure and damaging front and side walls of the church. </p>



<p>Two individuals that were in the vehicle were taken to a nearby hospital, where, police officials said, they were listed in stable condition. </p>



<p>Officials said an investigator from the City of Newark is expected to review the building for potential structural issues after the crash.</p>



<p>The scene, officials said, was cleared by about 5:32 a.m. and, officials said, an investigation is ongoing.</p>



<p>Anyone with information regarding this incident is asked to contact the Newark, Delaware police and by calling Detective James Skinner at 302-366-7100 ext. 3135 or via email at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:jskinner@newark.de.us" target="_blank">jskinner@newark.de.us</a>. </p>

								<excerpt><![CDATA[Here are our Eagles position grades after a 22-10 win over the Packers on Sunday afternoon.]]></excerpt>
								<description>
				<![CDATA[
<p>It wasn’t the prettiest win of all time but the Eagles were able to beat the Packers 22-10 on Sunday at the Linc to advance to the divisional round of the NFC playoffs.</p>



<p>While the Eagles’ offense had some trouble getting going, Vic Fangio’s defense stifled the Packers and the Eagles were able to hold on to win.</p>



<p>The Eagles will host either the Vikings or Rams next week in the divisional round.</p>



<p>Let’s get to the grades from Sunday:</p>



<p><strong>Quarterback</strong></p>



<p><em>Jalen Hurts: 13/21, 131 yards, 2 TDs; 6 carries, 36 yards</em></p>



<p>It wasn’t the best game for Jalen Hurts as he returned from his concussion. He completed just 61.9% of his passes in this game and took a couple sacks. But he was good when he had a really clean pocket; the pressure seemed to get to him in this one when the Packers did send blitzers with varying levels of success. While it wasn’t his best game, Hurts didn’t throw an interception and that was really important in this game. On the other side, Jordan Love threw three picks.</p>



<p><em>Grade: C+</em></p>



<p><strong>Running back</strong></p>



<p><em>Saquon Barkley: 25 carries, 119 yards</em></p>



<p>Saquon Barkley had to grind out his 119 yards on the ground and had just 2 catches for 4 yards. The Packers did a good job of limiting Barkley’s effectiveness but he did have a few big runs. His long was a 17-yarder. Barkley also had a nice play in pass pro on a completion to Dallas Goedert. Kenny Gainwell contributed 3 carries for 14 yards. Fullback Khari Blasingame was elevated and played just a couple of snaps.</p>



<p><em>Grade: B+</em></p>



<p><strong>Receiver</strong></p>



<p><em>DeVonta Smith: 4 catches on 4 targets, 55 yards</em></p>



<p>A.J. Brown was targeted 3 times and finished with just 1 catch for 10 yards, but at least he was able to catch up on some reading on the sideline and blocked his butt off. Hurts just missed Brown on a deep shot off the Tush Push look. DeVonta Smith led the way with 4 for 55, including a 28-yarder on a drag across the field that helped set up the Goedert touchdown. Jahan Dotson caught an 11-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter on a scramble drill; it was his first TD as an Eagle.</p>



<p><em>Grade: B</em></p>



<p><strong>Tight end</strong></p>



<p><em>Dallas Goedert: 4 catches on 6 targets for 47 yards, 1 TD</em></p>



<p>That 24-yard touchdown play from Goedert in the third quarter was a big-boy YAC play. Goedert ran through a defender on his way into the end zone. The Eagles had Goedert for just 10 games in the regular season but it’s clear just how much he means to the Eagles. He was their second-leading receiver against the Packers.</p>



<p><em>Grade: B+</em></p>



<p><strong>Offensive line</strong></p>



<p>On that touchdown pass to Dotson, Hurts had 6.75 seconds in the pocket to deliver that pass, according to NFL NextGen Stats. That was the longest time to throw on a TD pass from a clean pocket all season. When Hurts had a clean pocket, he completed 10 of 12 passes for 108 yards and 2 touchdowns. The Eagles faced some loaded boxes but still ended up with 169 rushing yards.</p>



<p><em>Grade: A-</em></p>



<p><strong>Defensive line</strong></p>



<p><em>Nolan Smith: 7 tackles, 2 sacks</em></p>



<p>In 15 games this season, Love had been sacked just 14 times in 15 games and he was brought down twice in this game. But Nolan Smith had both of them. The Eagles used a three-man edge rusher rotation in this game and Smith had a great game as a rusher and against the run. Some strong individual performances were also put out there by Jalen Carter and Milton Williams. Williams had just 1 tackle and 1 QB hit but he drew a couple penalties and beat up on backup guards. Jalen Carter’s batted pass was nearly picked off by Zack Baun. Moro Ojomo also got some pressure in this game. Bryce Huff didn’t get any snaps on defense; he’s behind rookie Jalyx Hunt.</p>



<p><em>Grade: A</em></p>



<p><strong>Linebacker</strong></p>



<p><em>Zack Baun: 7 tackles, 1 INT, 1 PBU</em></p>



<p>First-team All-Pro Zack Baun picked off a pass and was tied for second on the team in tackles. He again played like one of the best linebackers in the NFL. The Eagles lost Nakobe Dean to what appeared to be a serious knee injury in the second quarter. Dean was seen after the game on crutches and with his left knee in a brace. His replacement Oren Burks had some rough moments but will be needed going forward.</p>



<p><em>Grade: B+</em></p>



<p><strong>Secondary</strong></p>



<p><em>Darius Slay: 3 tackles, 1 INT, 1 PBU</em></p>



<p>The Eagles went all season without getting an interception from a cornerback but Darius Slay and Quinyon Mitchell both got interceptions in this one. It was the first of Mitchell’s career. He played great coverage all game but was called for a very questionable DPI. Reed Blankenship led the team with 11 tackles and a forced fumble. Jordan Love completed 20 of 33 passes for 212 yards and 3 interceptions. Cooper DeJean did a nice job against Jayden Reed in the slot. Isaiah Rodgers (for Slay) and Avonte Maddox (for C.J. Gardner-Johnson) were challenged when they were forced into action but both held up.</p>



<p><em>Grade: A</em></p>



<p><strong>Special teams</strong></p>



<p><em>Jake Elliott: 3/3 on FGs, 1/2 on PATs</em></p>



<p>The bad: Elliott missed an extra point and the Eagles gave up a 20-yard punt return to Jayden Reed. But Elliott made all three of his field goal attempts — 31 yards, 30 yards, 32 yards. And Oren Burks opened the game with a huge forced fumble on Keisean Nixon that was recovered by Jeremiah Trotter Jr. Nolan Smith was added to the kickoff coverage and was excited about it.</p>



<p><em>Grade: B+</em></p>



<p><strong>Coaching</strong></p>



<p><em>Record: 15-3</em></p>



<p>There were definitely some questionable play calls from Kellen Moore in this one as the Eagles failed to get Hurts into much of a rhythm. But Vic Fangio was masterful calling his defense against Matt LaFleur’s Packers offense. And it’s hard to argue with the result. Do the Eagles have things to clean up? Sure. But they get the opportunity to do that next week.</p>



<p><em>Grade: B+</em></p>

<p>All-Star reliever Jeff Hoffman and the Toronto Blue Jays have agreed to a $33 million, three-year contract.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.mlb.com/bluejays/news/jeff-hoffman-contract-with-blue-jays" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEqm0lwxD7_/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team announced the deal</a> Friday night, two days after his 32nd birthday.</p>







<p>Hoffman went 3-3 with a 2.17 ERA and 10 saves last season for the NL East champion Philadelphia Phillies, earning his first All-Star selection in July. He set career bests for ERA, saves and appearances (68).</p>



<p>The right-hander struck out 89 and walked 16 in 66 1/3 innings, holding opposing hitters to a .197 batting average and compiling a 0.96 WHIP before becoming a free agent. </p>



<p>“We are excited to add Jeff to our bullpen. His arsenal, strike throwing, and ability to miss bats against all types of hitters is elite and will undoubtedly make us better,” Toronto general manager Ross Atkins said in a news release. “Jeff will get an opportunity to close games for us this season. His track record, competitiveness, and experience make him a great complement to this group.&#8221; </p>



<p>Hoffman was chosen ninth overall by the Blue Jays in the 2014 amateur draft out of East Carolina, but has never pitched for them. He was traded the following year to Colorado with three other players in a blockbuster deal that brought star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and reliever LaTroy Hawkins to Toronto.</p>



<p>The 6-foot-5 Hoffman made his major league debut for the Rockies in 2016. He is 23-26 with a 4.82 ERA in 256 career games, including 50 starts, over nine seasons with Colorado, Cincinnati and Philadelphia.</p>



<p>Hoffman pitched six shutout innings over five appearances for the Phillies in the 2023 National League Championship Series against Arizona. But he struggled badly in last year&#8217;s playoffs versus the rival New York Mets, going 1-2 while allowing six runs in 1 1/3 innings over three outings in their Division Series.</p>



<p>Hoffman gets a $5 million signing bonus from the Blue Jays and salaries of $6 million this year and $11 million in each of the following two seasons. He can earn up to $2 million annually in performance bonuses for innings pitched: $500,000 each for 60, 70, 80 and 90.</p>



<p>After the deal was announced, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9lIBNruLuH/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9lIBNruLuH/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1">Hoffman posted a photo with his kids to Instagram</a> saying of his Phillies&#8217; tenure that it was &#8220;a time that I will never forget.&#8221;</p>







<p>In another roster move, Toronto right-hander Brett de Geus was designated for assignment.</p>

<p>A person armed with multiple assault rifles — including some attached to a car — was shot in <a href="http://nbcnewyork.com/tag/new-jersey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Jersey</a>, according to a senior law enforcement official.</p>





<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">
<p>A red sedan that appeared to have several assault rifles attached to it could be seen in a wooded area of Stanhope, video from NBC New York&#8217;s Chopper 4 showed. A large response by Byram Township Police was at the scene, as well.</p>
</div>



<p>The senior law enforcement officials said a person got out of the car with a firearm, and police opened fire. The person was shot in the neck and rushed to a nearby hospital. It was not immediately clear whether the gunshot wound was self-inflicted or it came as a result of police gunfire.</p>



<p>No further information was immediately available. The Sussex County Prosecutor’s Office was leading the investigation, according to the state attorney general’s office.</p>

<p>At least four people were hurt &#8212; some having to be cut out of a wrecked car &#8212; in a crash along Philadelphia&#8217;s Kelly Drive early Monday.</p>



<p>The crash took place just after 12:30 a.m. on Jan. 13, 2025, along Kelly Drive between the Strawberry Mansion Bridge and Fountain Green Drive in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia police accident investigators said.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/cuatro-heridos-accidente-transito-kelly-drive-filadelfia/2459300/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/cuatro-heridos-accidente-transito-kelly-drive-filadelfia/2459300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Léelo en español aquí</a></em>.</p>



<p>The driver of a southbound black Nissan crossed the double yellow line and struck a red Chevrolet going northbound, police said. The Nissan then struck a tree on the northwest side of the road before stopping.</p>



<p>Two people were trapped in one of the cars and had to be rescued, investigators said.</p>



<p>Later in the morning, the driver of the Nissan was listed in critical condition at a local hospital, while a Nissan passenger and both people in the Chevy were being treated in stable condition at area hospitals, police said.</p>



<p>Kelly Drive reopened in time for the morning rush.</p>



<p>The crash remained under investigation Monday.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The Eagles don’t know who they’re playing in the divisional round but they know when they’ll play.</p>



<p>The NFL announced on Sunday night that the Eagles will host the winner of the Vikings-Rams game next Sunday, Jan. 19 at 3 p.m. on NBC.</p>



<p>On Monday night, the Eagles will be watching the 5-seeded Vikings face the 4-seeded Rams in the final game of the NFC wild-card round. The winner will earn a trip to Philly for the divisional round to face the Eagles, who beat the Packers 22-10 on Sunday.</p>



<p>Here’s the full NFL divisional round schedule:</p>



<p><strong>Saturday, Jan. 18</strong></p>



<p>AFC — (4) Texans at (1) Chiefs, 4:30 p.m. on ESPN/ABC</p>



<p>NFC — (6) Commanders at (1) Lions on FOX</p>



<p><strong>Sunday, Jan. 19</strong></p>



<p>NFC — (5) Vikings/(4)Rams at (2) Eagles, 3 p.m. on NBC</p>



<p>AFC — (3) Ravens at (2) Bills, 6:30 p.m. on CBS</p>



<p>The Eagles did not face the Vikings this season but beat the Rams 37-20 in Week 12.</p>



<p>The Vikings and Rams play on Monday Night Football as the final wild-card game of the weekend. The game was moved to Arizona because of wildfires in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>It was a lot harder than it should have been. It was way more stressful than it needed to be. It was ugly at times, frustrating at times, bizarre at times.</p>



<p>In the end, the better team won.</p>



<p>The Eagles are onto the conference semifinal round after beating the Packers 22-10 in their wild-card-round game at the Linc.</p>



<p>Here’s our 10 instant observations after the Eagles’ first home wild-card win since they beat the Giants with Jeff Garcia in 2006. Yep, 18 years ago.</p>



<p><strong>1.</strong> It was the toughest draw any NFC No. 2 seed has ever had. Because up through 2019, the No. 2 seed had a 1st-round bye and since the No. 2 seed they’ve faced the 8-8 Bears in 2020, 9-8 Eagles in 2021, 9-8 Seahawks in 2022 and 9-8 Packers last year. So getting an 11-win Packers team wasn’t ideal, but you never heard them complain about it. They embraced the challenge head on and sent the Packers back to Wisconsin without any doubt who the better team was. This is an Eagles team that has been up for every challenge it’s faced this year, and Sunday was no different. They bounced back from the Saquon drop and loss to the Falcons in the home opener with a win in New Orleans, they bounced back from a blowout Week 4 loss in Tampa with a 10-game winning streak, they bounced back from losing Jalen Hurts to beat the Cowboys and Giants with backup quarterbacks and they bounced back from a nightmare fourth quarter in Washington to win their last two games. This is an incredibly talented team, and Howie Roseman deserves credit for that, but they’re also an incredibly resilient team, and that’s because of Nick Sirianni and the confidence he’s infused in his players, the work ethic he demands of them and the focus he requires of them. Don’t look ahead, don’t look back, focus only on the moment, and the formula works wonders. The Eagles are now 13-1 since the bye week, and they haven’t lost with Jalen Hurts at quarterback in 3 ½ months. They’re rolling and it’s going to take one hell of an effort by a very good team to stop them.</p>



<p><strong>2. </strong>This was a monster defensive effort against a dangerous offense that averaged 27 points per game during the regular season and was top-5 in yards, points and rushing yards per game. The Eagles held the Packers to 10 points and 262 yards until that meaningless final drive over the last few minutes and although Josh Jacobs finished with 81 yards, the vaunted Packers rushing attack never really got going. Darius Slay, Quinyon Mitchell and Zack Baun intercepted a quarterback who hadn’t been picked off in two months, Nolan Smith picked up two sacks against a quarterback who was only sacked 14 times all year and Vic Fangio’s group essentially did what it’s been doing since the bye week. Did not let an opposing offense do what it wanted to do. With the offense sputtering most of the game, the defense had to come up huge and they did. They carried this team to a crucial win. Youngest defense in the league. And the best.</p>



<p><strong>3. </strong>Through seven series, the Eagles had 29 net passing yards, and Jalen Hurts looked absolutely lost. The 11-yard touchdown to Jahan Dotson on the third play of the game was sweet, but the next six drives netted 18 net passing yards, and Hurts was missing open receivers, taking needless sacks, holding onto the ball too long, jittering around the pocket. With Hurts unable to extend any drives, the offense looked lifeless. Four drives from the start of the second quarter through early in the third netted nine yards. Then I don’t know how but he just woke up long enough to put together a clutch TD drive. Twenty-eight yards to DeVonta. Nine yards to DeVonta. Then the 24-yard touchdown to Dallas Goedert and just like that he was back and the Eagles were up 16-3. Should have been 17-3 but Jake Elliott missed another PAT. I don’t know what was going on with Hurts early, if it was just rust from the layoff or something else, but he’s just got to be better, and the passing offense has to be better. Way better. The positives: As shaky as he was, Hurts didn’t turn the ball over, didn’t make any mistakes. No fumbles or interceptions. Didn’t do anything to hurt the team. And he showed a lot of resilience bouncing back with that 3rd-quarter touchdown drive. And that final passer rating of 111.4 is pretty good. But he threw for just 131 yards, and the bottom line is Hurts has to be better and the passing game has to be better if the Eagles are going to keep winning.</p>



<p><strong>4. </strong>Speaking of Goedert. Wow. What a difference getting him back. He only played in nine regular-season games this year, but when he’s healthy I still believe he’s a top-5 tight end in the NFL, and he showed why Sunday. That 24-yard touchdown was brilliant, as he stiff-armed Packers corner Carrington Valentine for about 20 yards down the left sideline and into the end zone. Just a total destruction of a cornerback by a tight end. He’s such a physical player and not just blocking on the line of scrimmage but with the ball in his hands as well. Goedert finished with 4-for-47, and the four catches gave him 39 in the postseason, one more than Chad Lewis for the most in Eagles history. Dude is a beast.</p>



<p><strong>5.</strong> Saquon Barkley didn’t get rolling until the final minutes when he closed things out with a 17-yard run that should have been about a 35-yard run, but he runs so tough and so hard and even when he’s not busting a bunch of big gains he has such a big impact on the game. I thought Kellen Moore was a little slow to dial him up in the first half &#8211; he only had three carries on the Eagles’ last 17 plays before halftime. But Barkley finished with 25 carries for 119 yards against the NFL’s No. 3 run defense. And he helped the Eagles control this game on a day where not much on offense was working. And that’s the true definition of a star.</p>



<p><strong>6. </strong>You knew it was most likely a serious injury when Nakobe Dean didn’t even react as he was being helped off the field by a couple trainers and his closest friend on the team, Zack Baun, came over and shared some words of encouragement, and Dean didn’t even react. Dean got hurt Sunday not surprisingly making a three-yard tackle for loss on Tucker Kraft midway through the second quarter, and the Eagles quickly ruled him out for the rest of the game. Nothing official from the Eagles yet but Dean was seen leaving the locker room on crutches with a brace on his knee. What a loss. Dean has been so active, so productive, so physical, so consistent this year. His improvement from deep backup as a rookie to injured almost all of last year to Pro Bowl caliber linebacker play this year has been spectacular. One of the most under-rated linebackers in the NFL and definitely one of the most improved players on the team, along with college teammate Nolan Smith. Oren Burks is a smart, tough veteran who’ll empty the tank playing in place of Dean &#8211; you saw how physical he is when he forced that fumble on the opening kickoff &#8211; but he’s no Nakobe. If Dean is out for the rest of the postseason, that’s a huge blow for the NFL’s No. 1 defense.</p>



<p><strong>7.</strong> Jordan Love had thrown 173 consecutive passes without an interception, and the Eagles had just two interceptions in their last nine playoff games. Two streaks that truly went by the wayside Sunday. This was the first time since the conference semifinal win over the Bears at Soldier Field in Chicago in 2001 that the Eagles picked off three passes in a playoff game. That was Rashard Cook, Carlos Emmons and Damon Moore, and it was during Moore’s return that Hugh Douglas buried Jim Miller, effectively ending his career. (“I told him don’t move. He moved. The rest is history.”) That was also 24 years ago. So to see the Eagles pick off a quarterback who rarely throws them was huge. Was great to see Darius Slay finally get an interception after 21 straight games without one. He’s had a really good year and people don’t realize it because he didn’t have any picks. Zack Baun could have had a pick on one play and then got one on the next play. What a playmaker. And Quinyon Mitchell, he becomes the first Eagles 1st-round pick with an interception since Mike Patterson in 2008. Great stuff. The Eagles don’t intercept a ton of passes &#8211; this was the first time in 50 games they picked off three in any game. But those are winning plays. The Eagles needed every one of them.</p>



<p><strong>8.</strong> Nolan Smith has become such a kick-ass pass rusher, and he is such a fun player to watch. This is a kid who barely made an impact as a rookie and wow, look at him now. Two more sacks on top of 6 ½ during the regular season &#8211; all after the bye &#8211; and he almost had a third, and he just plays so hard all the time. He’s just relentless both as a pass rusher and against the run. Which you just don’t see from a guy who’s 6-2,&nbsp;<em>maybe&nbsp;</em>240. Jordan Love does not take many sacks. Only 14 all year, 2nd-fewest among all starting quarterbacks. But Smith is quickly developing into an elite pass rusher and in a post-Brandon Graham world that’s something the Eagles really needed.</p>



<p><strong>9.</strong> It was curious to see the Eagles pad up for their Wednesday practice at the Linc. We’re now 19 weeks into the season and this team has been going hard since training camp began in late July. And their bye was in Week 5 so they haven’t had a break in nearly four months. But on a very cold and windy day, Nick Sirianni wasn’t about to give them a light day or bring them to their indoor bubble. And here we are. Nick wanted his team to go out and practice in difficult conditions on a miserable day to get them into a playoff mindset, and they sure responded. And I think this is something Sirianni is really good at. Understanding what his team needs. Understanding when to work them to the bone. When to turn a full practice into a walkthrough. When to make a practice longer or tougher. He’s got such a keen sense of what his players need, and people are always asking what Nick really does, but understanding how to approach the week and the best way to get his players prepared for kickoff is a huge part of being a coach, and Nick is terrific&nbsp;at it.</p>



<p><strong>10.</strong> Maybe at some point in NFL history there was a guy who was a backup and a special teamer for four years and never really made an impact who went to a new team and was moved to a new position and in his first year made 1st-team all-pro playing for the best defense in the NFL. Maybe. I doubt it. Zack Baun is one of the wildest stories I’ve ever seen. The impact he’s made on this defense and this team is immeasurable, and once again Sunday he was all over the field &#8211; seven tackles, an interception, a pass deflection and even a special teams tackle. Baun on Friday raced out of the locker room as soon as it opened to the media because he’s such a team guy he just didn’t want to talk about making all-pro two days before a playoff game. He’s a special person and a special player and I keep saying this but Howie has to get him signed. Has to.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Two Green Bay Packers fans from Pennsylvania are speaking out after <a href="https://x.com/Basaraski/status/1878695599484346675" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/Basaraski/status/1878695599484346675">a viral video</a> of them being harassed by a foulmouthed Eagles fan during Sunday’s wild card game sparked outrage across the country.</p>



<p>Alex Basara and his fiancée Ally Keller, both of Chester County, told NBC10 they attended the Eagles-Packers game at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday. The couple said they first met up with a few friends who are Eagles fans before the game and engaged in fun banter. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ninety-nine percent of Eagles fans were playful banter,” Basara said. “The normal. I’ve been to 20 plus stadiums and it’s normally like that. Eagles is a little bit more harsh sometimes but it’s all in playful fun. They’ll say things to you but then they’ll shake your hand. They’ll say, ‘Hey, have a good time in the stadium.’”</p>



<p>Basara and Keller said the environment was friendly at the start. That was until an Eagles fan sitting behind them began to make comments during the game.</p>



<p>“He started out with playful jabs at first or kind of just saying things to us right when we sat down,” Basara said. “I chatted with him for a bit. But then he just kept saying some of the same things. Continued through the entire game. It got worse and worse as the game went on. We were surrounded by Eagles fans. We were getting all the attention.”</p>



<p>Basara and Keller said the fan became nastier and more condescending as the Eagles’ lead over the Packers grew. When the fan asked Basara if he was having a good time, Basara told him “not too great.” That’s when the fan told the couple that they had “terrible attitudes,” according to Keller.</p>



<p>“He went on to say that when he was in third grade, his teacher taught him to have a great attitude. And he was just going on and on and on,” Keller said. “He wanted something out of us. So, I turned around, because I kind of had enough of it at this point, and I said, ‘Well, maybe you should go back to third grade then because it seems like you’re the one with the bad attitude. And it seems like all the fans around us are the ones with the bad attitudes.’”</p>



<p>Keller said the fan appeared to not have heard her at first. He then insulted her.</p>



<p>“And then he just said, ‘Actually, you’re not even good looking enough to be talking to me,’” Keller told NBC10. “And then I said, you know, ‘What does that mean?’ And he said, ‘You know what that means.’ And so I said, ‘Have you looked in the mirror yourself?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, but I’m a man. I’m allowed to be ugly. You’re a woman.”</p>



<p>Keller and Basara said the fan’s harassment continued. Basara then spoke to a man who he believed was the fan’s brother and asked if he could get him under control. Basara said he also offered to switch seats with Keller but she didn’t want to.</p>



<p>“We both paid for tickets. We should both be able to enjoy the game. It was kind of like a pride thing,” Keller said. “Where it was like, no, I’m going to stand my ground. He could say these words to me and be mean to me but I’m not going to give him the satisfaction of changing my seat for him. And in hindsight, maybe I should’ve.”</p>

<p>Basara began to record the fan as the insults continued. <a href="https://x.com/Basaraski/status/1878695599484346675">In a video that went viral</a> after Basara posted it on his X account, the fan could be heard calling Keller a “dips&#8212;” and a “c&#8212;.”</p>



<p>The couple said they felt the environment turning hostile.</p>



<p>“He was making personal jabs at me,” Keller said. “It’s one thing if he’s going, ‘F the Packers,’ or whatever. But he’s talking about my looks the whole time. So, it got personal at that point.”</p>



<p>Despite her anger, Keller told NBC10 she was hesitant to lash out too much.</p>



<p>“There’s no women. There’s nobody defending me. There’s all Eagles fans allowing this to happen,” she said. “So, I didn’t want to turn around and yell at this guy and then have my fiancé get jumped in the crowd. So I was I guess trying to stay calm but I was pretty fuming at that point and just hopeful that another fan would tell this guy to stop. And everyone just kind of stood around and I guess allowed him to call me that name.”</p>



<p>Basara also said he tried to keep calm in order to keep them both safe.</p>



<p>“Everyone else around you is an Eagles fan,” Basara said. “And for the people around us that didn’t hear it because it’s a loud environment, if it did turn into an altercation or something physical, all they see is me messing with an Eagles fan and then I become the target. And then what happens with my fiancée at that time in that scenario? It’s a dangerous situation.”</p>



<p>Basara said him recording the fan is ultimately what helped deescalate the situation.</p>



<p>“His friend realized he was being recorded and tapped him and he stopped,” Basara said. “That was my way of deescalating the situation and making sure that both of us got out safe. Which we did. We both got out safe and then later in the game we moved to the end of the row because at that point a lot of fans had left because the game was essentially over and we made sure to also leave before that group of people so they weren’t behind us walking down the steps.”</p>



<p>Basara said they left without contacting security because they didn’t realize there was a QR code with a security contact on their seats. They later spoke with the Eagles on Monday and the team apologized for the fan’s behavior. Despite reports stating the team would gift them free Packers gear, Basara and Keller said they haven’t received that message from the team as of yet.</p>



<p>“I’ve seen posts that they’re going to send me Packers gear but they haven’t reached out personally to say that,” Keller said. “So I don’t know if it’s just people just saying that.”</p>



<p>After their experience, Basara and Keller said the only Eagles games they’ll attend in the future will be in Green Bay.</p>



<p>“In Lambeau, sure. I don’t think we’ll go to Philly again just because at this rate I don’t know if it’s necessarily worth it,” Basara said. “And I know not every fan is like that and I really hope no one has to endure that. And that was kind of my point of posting that video. Hopefully, this will make people understand that’s not okay. That’s not okay to do.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the Eagles told NBC10 that the incident has been addressed and that the fan who harassed Basara and Keller won’t be allowed to attend any future events at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>



<p>NBC10 has also made several attempts to reach out to the Eagles fan in the video. We have not yet heard back from him.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Two Green Bay Packers fans from Pennsylvania are speaking out after <a href="https://x.com/Basaraski/status/1878695599484346675" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/Basaraski/status/1878695599484346675">a viral video</a> of them being harassed by a foulmouthed Eagles fan during Sunday’s wild card game sparked outrage across the country.</p>



<p>Alex Basara and his fiancée Ally Keller, both of Chester County, told NBC10 they attended the Eagles-Packers game at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday. The couple said they first met up with a few friends who are Eagles fans before the game and engaged in fun banter. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ninety-nine percent of Eagles fans were playful banter,” Basara said. “The normal. I’ve been to 20 plus stadiums and it’s normally like that. Eagles is a little bit more harsh sometimes but it’s all in playful fun. They’ll say things to you but then they’ll shake your hand. They’ll say, ‘Hey, have a good time in the stadium.’”</p>



<p>Basara and Keller said the environment was friendly at the start. That was until an Eagles fan sitting behind them began to make comments during the game.</p>



<p>“He started out with playful jabs at first or kind of just saying things to us right when we sat down,” Basara said. “I chatted with him for a bit. But then he just kept saying some of the same things. Continued through the entire game. It got worse and worse as the game went on. We were surrounded by Eagles fans. We were getting all the attention.”</p>



<p>Basara and Keller said the fan became nastier and more condescending as the Eagles’ lead over the Packers grew. When the fan asked Basara if he was having a good time, Basara told him “not too great.” That’s when the fan told the couple that they had “terrible attitudes,” according to Keller.</p>



<p>“He went on to say that when he was in third grade, his teacher taught him to have a great attitude. And he was just going on and on and on,” Keller said. “He wanted something out of us. So, I turned around, because I kind of had enough of it at this point, and I said, ‘Well, maybe you should go back to third grade then because it seems like you’re the one with the bad attitude. And it seems like all the fans around us are the ones with the bad attitudes.’”</p>



<p>Keller said the fan appeared to not have heard her at first. He then insulted her.</p>



<p>“And then he just said, ‘Actually, you’re not even good looking enough to be talking to me,’” Keller told NBC10. “And then I said, you know, ‘What does that mean?’ And he said, ‘You know what that means.’ And so I said, ‘Have you looked in the mirror yourself?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, but I’m a man. I’m allowed to be ugly. You’re a woman.”</p>



<p>Keller and Basara said the fan’s harassment continued. Basara then spoke to a man who he believed was the fan’s brother and asked if he could get him under control. Basara said he also offered to switch seats with Keller but she didn’t want to.</p>



<p>“We both paid for tickets. We should both be able to enjoy the game. It was kind of like a pride thing,” Keller said. “Where it was like, no, I’m going to stand my ground. He could say these words to me and be mean to me but I’m not going to give him the satisfaction of changing my seat for him. And in hindsight, maybe I should’ve.”</p>

<p>Basara began to record the fan as the insults continued. <a href="https://x.com/Basaraski/status/1878695599484346675">In a video that went viral</a> after Basara posted it on his X account, the fan could be heard calling Keller a “dips&#8212;” and a “c&#8212;.”</p>



<p>The couple said they felt the environment turning hostile.</p>



<p>“He was making personal jabs at me,” Keller said. “It’s one thing if he’s going, ‘F the Packers,’ or whatever. But he’s talking about my looks the whole time. So, it got personal at that point.”</p>



<p>Despite her anger, Keller told NBC10 she was hesitant to lash out too much.</p>



<p>“There’s no women. There’s nobody defending me. There’s all Eagles fans allowing this to happen,” she said. “So, I didn’t want to turn around and yell at this guy and then have my fiancé get jumped in the crowd. So I was I guess trying to stay calm but I was pretty fuming at that point and just hopeful that another fan would tell this guy to stop. And everyone just kind of stood around and I guess allowed him to call me that name.”</p>



<p>Basara also said he tried to keep calm in order to keep them both safe.</p>



<p>“Everyone else around you is an Eagles fan,” Basara said. “And for the people around us that didn’t hear it because it’s a loud environment, if it did turn into an altercation or something physical, all they see is me messing with an Eagles fan and then I become the target. And then what happens with my fiancée at that time in that scenario? It’s a dangerous situation.”</p>



<p>Basara said him recording the fan is ultimately what helped deescalate the situation.</p>



<p>“His friend realized he was being recorded and tapped him and he stopped,” Basara said. “That was my way of deescalating the situation and making sure that both of us got out safe. Which we did. We both got out safe and then later in the game we moved to the end of the row because at that point a lot of fans had left because the game was essentially over and we made sure to also leave before that group of people so they weren’t behind us walking down the steps.”</p>



<p>Basara said they left without contacting security because they didn’t realize there was a QR code with a security contact on their seats. They later spoke with the Eagles on Monday and the team apologized for the fan’s behavior. Despite reports stating the team would gift them free Packers gear, Basara and Keller said they haven’t received that message from the team as of yet.</p>



<p>“I’ve seen posts that they’re going to send me Packers gear but they haven’t reached out personally to say that,” Keller said. “So I don’t know if it’s just people just saying that.”</p>



<p>After their experience, Basara and Keller said the only Eagles games they’ll attend in the future will be in Green Bay.</p>



<p>“In Lambeau, sure. I don’t think we’ll go to Philly again just because at this rate I don’t know if it’s necessarily worth it,” Basara said. “And I know not every fan is like that and I really hope no one has to endure that. And that was kind of my point of posting that video. Hopefully, this will make people understand that’s not okay. That’s not okay to do.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the Eagles told NBC10 that the incident has been addressed and that the fan who harassed Basara and Keller won’t be allowed to attend any future events at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>



<p>NBC10 has also made several attempts to reach out to the Eagles fan in the video. We have not yet heard back from him.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/music-and-musicians/" target="_blank">Sam &amp; Dave</a> that was known for such definitive hits of the era as “Soul Man” and “Hold On, I&#8217;m Comin,’” has died. He was 89. </p>



<p>Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coral Gables, Florida, </a>due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.</p>



<p>Moore, whose admirers ranged from Al Green to Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.</p>



<p>“Over on E Street, we are heartbroken to hear of the death of Sam Moore, one of America&#8217;s greatest soul voices,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEsep-aPTl7/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Springsteen said Saturday on Instagram</a>. “He was filled with stories of the halcyon days of soul music, and to the end had that edge of deep authenticity in his voice I could only wonder at.”</p>







<p>At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater ranked only behind Otis Redding as the label&#8217;s biggest stars. They transformed the “call and response” of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music’s most enduring hits, which also included “You Don’t Know Like I Know,” “When Something is Wrong With My Baby” and “I Thank You.”</p>



<p>Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. &amp; the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music’s most famous shoutouts when Sam &amp; Dave called “Play it, Steve” midway through “Soul Man.”</p>



<p>Like many ’60s soul acts, Sam &amp; Dave faded after the decade ended. But “Soul Man” hit the charts again in the late 1970s when “Blues Brothers” John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the “Saturday Night Live” stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.</p>

<p>In 2008, the movie “Soul Men” depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam &amp; Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.</p>



<p>He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam &amp; Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia. </p>



<p>In 1993, Moore was among numerous artists who pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated them out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.</p>



<p>Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.</p>



<p>“Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?” Moore said then. “If you’re making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don’t give me cornbread and tell me it’s biscuits.”</p>



<p>Moore also became involved in politics. He wrote the song “Dole Man,” modeled on “Soul Man,” for Republican Bob Dole’s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump’s inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama’s campaign used “Hold On, I’m Comin’.”</p>



<p>Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.</p>



<p>He and Prater performed in soul and R&amp;B clubs in the 1950s, but didn’t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label’s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.</p>



<p>Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band’s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit, though Moore did work often with Springsteen, whom Moore would call one of his closest friends. They performed together on stage and sang on each other&#8217;s albums, including on the high energy duet “Real World.”</p>



<p>“RIP Sam Moore,&#8221; Springsteen sideman Steve Van Zandt posted on X. &#8220;Him and Dave Prater were the inspiration for me and Johnny to start Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. An important righteous wonderful man.” </p>



<p>He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction that he credited with saving his life.</p>



<p>“I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,&#8221; during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.</p>



<p>“That’s funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I’m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.”</p>



<p>Moore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and sang for Obama among other presidents.</p>



<p>Moore is survived by his wife, Joyce; daughter, Michell; and two grandchildren.</p>

<p>Two Green Bay Packers fans from Pennsylvania are speaking out after <a href="https://x.com/Basaraski/status/1878695599484346675" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/Basaraski/status/1878695599484346675">a viral video</a> of them being harassed by a foulmouthed Eagles fan during Sunday’s wild card game sparked outrage across the country.</p>



<p>Alex Basara and his fiancée Ally Keller, both of Chester County, told NBC10 they attended the Eagles-Packers game at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday. The couple said they first met up with a few friends who are Eagles fans before the game and engaged in fun banter. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ninety-nine percent of Eagles fans were playful banter,” Basara said. “The normal. I’ve been to 20 plus stadiums and it’s normally like that. Eagles is a little bit more harsh sometimes but it’s all in playful fun. They’ll say things to you but then they’ll shake your hand. They’ll say, ‘Hey, have a good time in the stadium.’”</p>



<p>Basara and Keller said the environment was friendly at the start. That was until an Eagles fan sitting behind them began to make comments during the game.</p>



<p>“He started out with playful jabs at first or kind of just saying things to us right when we sat down,” Basara said. “I chatted with him for a bit. But then he just kept saying some of the same things. Continued through the entire game. It got worse and worse as the game went on. We were surrounded by Eagles fans. We were getting all the attention.”</p>



<p>Basara and Keller said the fan became nastier and more condescending as the Eagles’ lead over the Packers grew. When the fan asked Basara if he was having a good time, Basara told him “not too great.” That’s when the fan told the couple that they had “terrible attitudes,” according to Keller.</p>



<p>“He went on to say that when he was in third grade, his teacher taught him to have a great attitude. And he was just going on and on and on,” Keller said. “He wanted something out of us. So, I turned around, because I kind of had enough of it at this point, and I said, ‘Well, maybe you should go back to third grade then because it seems like you’re the one with the bad attitude.

I’m allowed to be ugly. You’re a woman.”</p>



<p>Keller and Basara said the fan’s harassment continued. Basara then spoke to a man who he believed was the fan’s brother and asked if he could get him under control. Basara said he also offered to switch seats with Keller but she didn’t want to.</p>



<p>“We both paid for tickets. We should both be able to enjoy the game. It was kind of like a pride thing,” Keller said. “Where it was like, no, I’m going to stand my ground. He could say these words to me and be mean to me but I’m not going to give him the satisfaction of changing my seat for him. And in hindsight, maybe I should’ve.”</p>

<p>Basara began to record the fan as the insults continued. <a href="https://x.com/Basaraski/status/1878695599484346675">In a video that went viral</a> after Basara posted it on his X account, the fan could be heard calling Keller a “dips&#8212;” and a “c&#8212;.”</p>



<p>The couple said they felt the environment turning hostile.</p>



<p>“He was making personal jabs at me,” Keller said. “It’s one thing if he’s going, ‘F the Packers,’ or whatever. But he’s talking about my looks the whole time. So, it got personal at that point.”</p>



<p>Despite her anger, Keller told NBC10 she was hesitant to lash out too much.</p>



<p>“There’s no women. There’s nobody defending me. There’s all Eagles fans allowing this to happen,” she said. “So, I didn’t want to turn around and yell at this guy and then have my fiancé get jumped in the crowd. So I was I guess trying to stay calm but I was pretty fuming at that point and just hopeful that another fan would tell this guy to stop. And everyone just kind of stood around and I guess allowed him to call me that name.”</p>



<p>Basara also said he tried to keep calm in order to keep them both safe.</p>



<p>“Everyone else around you is an Eagles fan,” Basara said. “And for the people around us that didn’t hear it because it’s a loud environment, if it did turn into an altercation or something physical, all they see is me messing with an Eagles fan and then I become the target. And then what happens with my fiancée at that time in that scenario? It’s a dangerous situation.”</p>



<p>Basara said him recording the fan is ultimately what helped deescalate the situation.</p>



<p>“His friend realized he was being recorded and tapped him and he stopped,” Basara said. “That was my way of deescalating the situation and making sure that both of us got out safe. Which we did. We both got out safe and then later in the game we moved to the end of the row because at that point a lot of fans had left because the game was essentially over and we made sure to also leave before that group of people so they weren’t behind us walking down the steps.”</p>



<p>Basara said they left without contacting security because they didn’t realize there was a QR code with a security contact on their seats. They later spoke with the Eagles on Monday and the team apologized for the fan’s behavior. Despite reports stating the team would gift them free Packers gear, Basara and Keller said they haven’t received that message from the team as of yet.</p>



<p>“I’ve seen posts that they’re going to send me Packers gear but they haven’t reached out personally to say that,” Keller said. “So I don’t know if it’s just people just saying that.”</p>



<p>After their experience, Basara and Keller said the only Eagles games they’ll attend in the future will be in Green Bay.</p>



<p>“In Lambeau, sure. I don’t think we’ll go to Philly again just because at this rate I don’t know if it’s necessarily worth it,” Basara said. “And I know not every fan is like that and I really hope no one has to endure that. And that was kind of my point of posting that video. Hopefully, this will make people understand that’s not okay. That’s not okay to do.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the Eagles told NBC10 that the incident has been addressed and that the fan who harassed Basara and Keller won’t be allowed to attend any future events at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>



<p>NBC10 has also made several attempts to reach out to the Eagles fan in the video. We have not yet heard back from him.</p>

								<excerpt><![CDATA[After months of planning and ongoing debate, the planners behind the proposal to bring a Sixers arena to Center City Philadelphia have backtracked on the project. Instead, the team will stay in South Philly.]]></excerpt>

				<![CDATA[
<p><em><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note (Jan. 13, 2025, 1:49 p.m.)</strong>: City, business and sports leaders announced the plan to build a new arena in partnership in South Philadelphia. <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/philly-mayor-parker-sixers-center-city-arena-exit/4076196/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/philly-mayor-parker-sixers-center-city-arena-exit/4076196/">Check out their remarks</a>.</em></p>



<p>In a move that will likely stun many, the plan to bring <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/city-council-to-hold-final-vote-on-1-3b-76ers-center-city-arena-plan/4058338/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/city-council-to-hold-final-vote-on-1-3b-76ers-center-city-arena-plan/4058338/" target="_blank">a $1.3 billion arena to Market Street in Center City Philadelphia</a> has been abandoned.</p>



<p>On Sunday, around noon, a union representative and city official confirmed with NBC10 that the team has worked out a new deal with Comcast Spectacor and has backpedaled on a plan that would have brought an arena to the area of the intersection of Market and Filbert streets at 10th and 11th streets.</p>



<p>Ryan Boyer, president of the Philadelphia Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/author/lauren-mayk/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/author/lauren-mayk/" target="_blank">NBC10&#8217;s Lauren Mayk</a> that instead, the team plans to demolish Wells Fargo Center and will eventually build a new arena in South Philadelphia for the Sixers and Flyers.</p>



<p>&#8220;We actually get more jobs,&#8221; Boyer said. &#8220;For the building trades, this is good news.&#8221; </p>



<p>In a statement released Sunday afternoon, officials with Local 98 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers also celebrated the decision, saying that the move will see the stadium district in South Philadelphia &#8220;enhanced and expanded.&#8221;</p>



<p>“IBEW Local 98 and our partners in the Philadelphia Building Trades have worked diligently with the 76ers throughout this protracted process. This new agreement between the 76ers and Comcast is a significant win for the 76ers, Comcast, our members and the entire City of Philadelphia. The Stadium District in South Philadelphia will be dramatically enhanced and expanded, providing the 76ers with the new state-of-the-art arena the team needs and deserves,&#8221; an IBEW representative said in a statement. &#8220;Comcast has also pledged to commit the financial resources needed to revive the dormant Market East corridor, which is critically important to the entire city. For IBEW Local 98 and the Trades, a $1.3 billion project just turned into a multi-billion development that will create a stunning new stadium district that will keep our members working for decades.”</p>



<p>However, Philadelphia City Councilmember at-large, Jim Harrity, said he was disappointed in the surprise move. In fact, he said, he felt &#8220;bamboozled.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;I feel completely bamboozled,” Harrity said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to forget this&#8230; I feel they not only bamboozled me but bamboozled the citizens of Philadelphia and I’m not going to forget that.”</p>



<p>Harrity said he is upset that the city&#8217;s schools won&#8217;t get the promised money from taxes the new arena would bring.</p>



<p>The plan had been approved by Philadelphia&#8217;s City Council late last year. </p>

<p>The plan had long been a contentious one, with many residents in communities closest to the project site protesting against it since it was initially proposed.</p>



<p>In the late months of last year, in the run up to a City Council vote on the project, city officials &#8212; including Mayor Cherelle Parker &#8212; met with members of the community all across the city to determine the future of the project.</p>



<p>Before City Council eventually approved the plan on Dec. 19, 2024, a main issue with the project was just how much funding would be included in the community benefits agreement. Initially, developers proposed a $50 million agreement, but residents closest to the project called for more &#8212; as much as $300 million.</p>



<p>Eventually, City Council approved the plan with a $60 million community benefits agreement. </p>



<p>Developers had planned to begin development this year and open the arena in 2031.</p>



<p>The specifics of the deal that led to the decision to stay in South Philadelphia have not yet been provided by officials.</p>



<p>But, according to a source with information on the situation, the Sixers and Flyers are expected to partner on a new arena in South Philadelphia with Comcast Spectacor.</p>



<p>The Sixers and Comcast Spectacor will also work on a revitalization project for the Market East neighborhood in Center City Philadelphia, according to the source. </p>



<p>Philadelphia councilmember Kendra Brooks &#8212; who had opposed the Center City plan &#8212; was happy with Sunday&#8217;s news but wanted more details on the new deal. </p>



<p>“We said that we didn’t think that this was a good deal from the beginning, both Nicolas O’Rourke and I. As minority leaders, we both said that we were gonna go with the side of the people,&#8221; Brooks said. “I’m interested to know the details behind what happened. We spent a lot of time and effort and resources on hearings that lasted through the end of the year that could have been spent towards other issues that we’ve been focusing on. So, I’d really like to know the details and what’s next.”</p>



<p>The No Arena Coalition &#8212; a group made up of thousands of organizations strongly opposed to the Center City arena plan &#8212; also reacted to Sunday&#8217;s news. </p>



<p>“We’re relieved to hear that the nightmare of a Center City Sixers arena will not haunt our city any more. To every Philadelphian who called, marched, testified, and warned City Hall that this was a raw deal: This win belongs to you, and the lesson for politicians is to trust the people. To the five Councilmembers who stood on the right side of this fight: We will not forget,&#8221; a spokesperson for the group wrote. </p>



<p>“Over the past two years, Philly built a movement not only to save Chinatown, but to defend our entire city from predatory billionaires who saw us for a profit playground, and tens of thousands of Philadelphians showed up. When some said it was a done deal, this movement stayed true, committed to a different kind of city.&#8221;</p>



<p>A press conference on the decision is expected to be held on Monday morning, Jan. 13, 2025. </p>



<p>Contacted on Sunday, officials with the Sixers, Comcast and the City of Philadelphia, did not immediately return requests for comment.</p>
