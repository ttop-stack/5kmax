<p><a href="https://www.unscriptedproject.org/">The Unscripted Project</a> is a free after-school program that empowers public school students with the skills and mindset for personal and professional success through improv education. By participating in these classes, students gain confidence, find their voices, and develop a mindset that helps them thrive. The program believes in the power of improv to shape students into well-rounded, capable individuals and responsible citizens. As of March 2024, over 2,300 students across 108 classrooms have completed their ten-week Core Program.</p>



<p>NBC10, Telemundo62, and the Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation have awarded The Unscripted Project a $10,000 grant through the Local Impact Grant program to support their Youth Education &amp; Empowerment initiatives. This funding will enable the organization to maintain and expand its in-school and after-school improv theater programs, reaching 1,200 students each school year. Additionally, the grant will help launch the Unscripted House Team Afterschool program and extend their reach to five new schools within the School District of Philadelphia.</p>



<p>The Unscripted Core Program promotes the principles and techniques of improv as tools for fostering socio-emotional learning and preparing students for college and careers. Delivered through 10 in-school, classroom-based workshops, the program was developed with guidance from their partners at Magnet Theater in New York, Philly Improv Theater, and The Second City in Chicago.</p>



<p>Each week focuses on a key concept, incorporating warm-ups, exercises, and debriefs. The lessons are designed with trauma-informed teaching practices, offering diverse entry points for participation and enabling educators to tailor their approach to meet the needs of all students, including those with special needs, autism, and English Language Learners.</p>



<p>The Unscripted Project has made a significant impact on the lives of students across Philadelphia, serving as a safe space for self-expression, creativity, and growth. The nonprofit&#8217;s dedication to providing equal access to quality arts education is reflected in its outreach to underserved communities. By offering its programs free of charge, The Unscripted Project ensures that every student has the opportunity to benefit from this experience.</p>



<p>As The Unscripted Project grows, its mission remains clear: to provide young people with the skills they need to thrive. Through the power of improv education, the nonprofit is helping students chase their dreams, build lasting confidence, and lead successful, fulfilling lives.</p>

<p><a href="https://teachersteammates.org/">Teachers’ Teammates</a> is a nonprofit in Delaware County, PA, that provides K-12 students and teachers the tools they need to succeed. Founded in 2020 by Raelyn Harman, the organization collects and distributes free school supplies, focusing on supporting educators in under-resourced schools.</p>



<p>NBC10, Telemundo62, and the Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation have awarded Teachers’ Teammates a $35,000 grant through the Local Impact Grant program to support their Community Engagement efforts. This funding will help them manage the growing volume of product donations, fulfill more teacher orders, and distribute an increasing amount of school supplies across the schools they serve. Additionally, the grant will allow the hiring of a part-time Community Engagement Manager to oversee expanded operations.</p>



<p>What began in Harman&#8217;s garage quickly grew due to overwhelming demand, leading to the opening of a warehouse in Folcroft, PA, where they now have everything a teacher might need to supply a classroom—from basic school supplies to educational materials. Teachers’ Teammates now serves seven school districts in Delaware County, offering a wide range of supplies from community donations and surplus goods. The organization operates a free online store where teachers can shop for materials each quarter, with the average order valued at around $500. A two-year membership costs $40, often covered by schools or local organizations. This system provides teachers with the flexibility to choose the supplies that best suit their students’ needs, ensuring that each classroom is equipped with materials that will help students thrive.</p>



<p>Raelyn Harman, a former social worker, was inspired by the lack of teacher resource centers in southeastern Pennsylvania and the large amount of unused supplies. Raelyn is acutely aware that many perfectly good items, sometimes even brand new, are discarded or left unused. “Most people would rather see these items be put to good use but have no convenient way of getting them to the appropriate recipient,” she says. Teachers’ Teammates addresses both the surplus of materials and the shortage in schools, offering an easy way for individuals and businesses to donate goods or volunteer time.</p>



<p>By facilitating the donation of surplus supplies from retired teachers, community members, and businesses, the organization is able to provide teachers with a variety of resources to support their classrooms. Items are carefully inspected for quality and usability, ensuring that all supplies meet the needs of both students and educators.</p>



<p>Since its launch, the organization has distributed over <strong>$2 million in supplies</strong>. Teachers’ Teammates helps ensure that classrooms are equipped, and students have the resources they need to succeed. Whether you&#8217;re a teacher in need of supplies, a community member looking to donate, or a business seeking a way to give back, Teachers’ Teammates offers a unique and impactful opportunity to invest in the future of education in Delaware County.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://artsmart.org/">ArtSmart</a> transforms the lives of young people in underserved communities around the United States through tuition-free music lessons and mentorship from paid, professional artists. ArtSmart offers private voice and instrumental lessons through its One-to-One Mentorship Program as well as a Vocal Theater Mentorship program, where small groups create original performances that amplify student voices and explore community issues. Mentors and students meet weekly for the entire school year during the school day to maximize access and minimize barriers to participation. Their music mentorship program aims to provide young people a pathway to academic, economic, and emotional stability. They enable their students to thrive in all areas of life by providing them with the resources and deep connections necessary for their creative and personal development.</p>



<p>As part of the Local Impact Grant program, NBC10, Telemundo62, and the Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation have given nearly $35,000 in grant funding to ArtSmart to support the programmatic operations of their One-To-One and Vocal Theater Music Mentorship Programs in Philadelphia. This includes funding four music mentorship studios for an entire 28-week program year in 2024-2025 which will ensure that more under-resourced youth receive arts education and mentorship to become empowered leaders in their communities.</p>



<p>ArtSmart was founded by operatic tenors Michael Fabiano and John Viscardi, who met at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia and have been friends for over a decade. They shared a vision of making a difference in the world of music. Acknowledging the impact of their voice teachers, they recognized that many students struggle to access quality music lessons and mentorship due to the high costs of private lessons. They also wanted to provide a pathway for&nbsp; musicians to make a living doing something directly related to their area of expertise. This shared passion led to the creation of <strong><em>ArtSmart.</em></strong></p>



<p>ArtSmart begins each year with auditions for students interested in the program. Those who are accepted are paired with a mentor. After an orientation, they start their lessons, developing a strong relationship with their mentor and collaboratively setting goals. Students participate in two on-stage recitals, receive masterclasses from professional artists, and gain access to artistic enrichment opportunities. Since its inception, ArtSmart has delivered over 10,000 music lessons and mentorship to students in Philadelphia and over 45,000 sessions nationwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To identify schools most in need of their programs, ArtSmart maintains close partnerships with the School District of Philadelphia. Within those school partners, ArtSmart collaborates with designated Site Ambassadors who serve as liaisons between students, mentors, and program staff, helping to identify students who would benefit most from participating in ArtSmart.</p>



<p>ArtSmart’s success is largely due to students building strong, positive relationships with adult role models, allowing them to use artistic expression to communicate freely within that connection. The program equips students with essential skills, such as setting and achieving goals, navigating challenges healthily, and gaining the self-confidence to advocate for their beliefs &#8211; and they have the data to prove that it works.</p>



<p>In June 2023, ArtSmart concluded a two-year longitudinal study in partnership with the WCG Institutional Review Board to evaluate its impact on student social, emotional, and academic outcomes. Key findings show that ArtSmart has a positive, causal impact on students that goes well beyond music education. Participation in ArtSmart significantly boosts students&#8217; intentions to pursue higher education, nurtures meaningful connections with adults at school, provides students with an adult they can talk to when stressed or having problems, and is a driving factor in excitement to attend school. </p>



<p>Through these comprehensive benefits, ArtSmart creates a ripple effect of positive change for individuals and communities by equipping youth with the skills, confidence, relationships, and ambition to succeed in all walks of life.</p>

<p>NBC10 and Telemundo62 have joined community organizations and elected leaders to host a <strong>free</strong> U.S. Citizenship Application Assistance Workshop on <strong>Saturday, October 19</strong>, from 10AM to 4PM at Camden City Hall (520 Market Street, Second Floor, Camden, NJ). The event is open to eligible applicants from throughout the Greater Philadelphia region. Those interested should call NALEO Educational Fund at 888-839-8682 to register or for more details about the event or the U.S. Citizenship application process. Registration is mandatory to help applicants prepare for a successful application process.</p>



<p>During the October 19 event at Camden City Hall, applicants will be assisted with all the steps of the application process in one day. Their applications will be reviewed by immigration attorneys and United States Department of Justice accredited representatives. The process will also include assistance applying for the fee waiver and fee reduction benefits to help lower the cost of the application fee for those who are eligible. This application process would ordinarily take several weeks and cost applicants thousands of dollars, but organizers will use NALEO Educational Fund’s workshop model, which allows the process to be completed in one day and for free. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Dornsife Equity Research Institute at the University of Southern California estimates that there are more than nine million Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) in the United States who are eligible to apply for U.S. Citizenship through the naturalization process. Close to 95,000 of those nine million live in the Philadelphia area. These residents need access to information about the application process and about the free and low-cost services available to them in their communities to start the application process. </p>



<p>U.S. Citizenship confers eligible applicants the right to vote and stand for public office in American elections. It also allows individuals the ability to travel abroad without time limitations. Additionally, several Federal and law enforcement jobs require U.S. Citizenship. Studies have also shown that attaining U.S. Citizenship is linked to higher rates of homeownership among immigrant Americans.</p>



<p>Please call NALEO Educational Fund at 888-839-8682 to register and help spread the word about this free opportunity to obtain application assistance.</p>

The Celebrate Philadelphia block party series will feature performances, engaging conversations, sponsor activations, community tabling, giveaways, and more.</p>



<p>The next Celebrate Philadelphia block party will take place on the following date and location:</p>



<p><strong><mark class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Block Party 2 – Saturday, Oct 19, 2024 from 1PM &#8211; 6PM at 2301 N. Broad Street</mark></strong></p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>“Welcome America is proud to be partnering with Every Voice Every Vote and When We All Vote to produce the Celebrate Philadelphia block party series,” said Nicole Allen, Chief Operating Officer, Welcome America, Inc. “Voting and participation in our democracy is something to celebrate, and celebration is what Welcome America does best. Projects like this are a natural extension of the festivals and events that we are known for, and we are thrilled to be able to utilize expertise to create events that encourage Philadelphians to engage in their community and make their voices heard.”</p>

When We All Vote is on a mission to increase participation in each and every election by meeting voters where they are.

<p>In addition to performances and other activations, each block party will include exciting and relevant dialogue curated by <strong>A Seat at the Table Foundation </strong>(ASATT), a community-driven initiative in Philadelphia, aimed at increasing voter turnout and fostering civic engagement, particularly among millennials, Generation Z, and underrepresented communities by combining a focus on voter education, community mobilization, and inclusive panel discussions to empower individuals to participate in the democratic process. ASATT seeks to address systemic barriers and amplify the voices of marginalized groups, ultimately striving to strengthen democracy at the grassroots level.</p>



<p>The Committee of Seventy, Pennsylvania’s leading nonpartisan advocate for better government and stronger democracy, will also be serving as a voter information hub, providing essential election information for adults to help them prepare to vote, as well as activities for children to begin engaging in the democratic process.</p>



<p>“Celebrating democracy means celebrating the voices of every voter, and the Celebrate Philadelphia block party series is a fantastic way to bring the community together for that purpose,” said Lauren Cristella, President and CEO of the Committee of Seventy. “We’re excited to be a part of this event to provide voters with the information they need to cast their ballots confidently and to inspire even the youngest Philadelphians to start thinking about their role in our democracy.”</p>



<p>&#8220;The Celebrate Philadelphia series is an incredible way for Philadelphians to be heard, be engaged, be accountable, and take action while celebrating the power we have in our democracy. We&#8217;re grateful to When We All Vote and our Every Voice, Every Vote partner Welcome America Inc. for leading this effort and supporting Every Voice, Every Vote&#8217;s larger mission to catalyze everyday civic action in Philadelphia,” said Shawn Mooring, Head of Philadelphia Programs for the Lenfest Institute and team lead for Every Voice, Every Vote.</p>

<p>The <strong>13th annual</strong> <strong><em><a href="https://www.penn.museum/calendar/356/culturefest">CultureFest! Día de los Muertos</a></em></strong>, presented in partnership with the <a href="https://mexicanculturalcenter.org/">Mexican Cultural Center</a>, will present Mexico&#8217;s rich cultural heritage at the Penn Museum! On <strong>Saturday, October 26, 2024, from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm</strong>.</p>



<p>“One of the most significant and colorful traditions in Mexican culture is Día de Los Muertos, the ‘Day of the Dead.’ The Penn Museum helps to bring that day to life by celebrating the rich cultural heritage that blends Indigenous beliefs with traditions during Spanish colonization,” says Araceli Guenther, President, Board of Directors of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mexicanculturalcenter.org/" target="_blank">Mexican Cultural Center</a>. “It also fosters a sense of community and national pride, while educating both the Mexican community and residents from different backgrounds about Mexico’s diverse cultural landscape.”</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>all-day festival</strong>&nbsp;includes an artisan marketplace,&nbsp;<strong>activities</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>live performances</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>11:05 am-11:30 am “Esmeralda LaCor” (music)</li>



<li>11:40 am-11:45 am Welcoming remarks</li>



<li>11:45 am-12:15 pm “Juntas Chicas” (music)</li>



<li>12:35 pm-1:05 pm “Payaso Bombin” (clown)</li>



<li>1:20 pm-1:50 pm “Ballet Folklorico Yaretzi” (dance)</li>



<li>2:00 pm-2:45 pm “Juntas Chicas” (music)</li>
</ul>



<p>At 3 pm, visitors can enjoy free samples of &#8220;Day of the Dead&#8221; bread and Mexican hot chocolate. At 3:20 pm, the winners of the community altar contest will be announced by the organizers.</p>



<p>“We are grateful for the long-standing partnership with the Mexican Cultural Center and the Mexican Consulate in Philadelphia,” says Jennifer Brehm, Director of Learning and Public Engagement. “For 13 years, Penn Museum has demonstrated its commitment to preserving and sharing the rich cultural and artistic traditions of the Latine and Hispanic communities through&nbsp;<em>CultureFest!&nbsp;<strong>Día de Los Muertos</strong></em>, an important tradition for honoring ancestors. We invite everyone to join us in celebrating this cultural heritage.”</p>



<p><strong>A monumental ofrenda—an elaborate communal altar that honors those who have passed—will serve as the event’s centerpiece.</strong>&nbsp;Artists Martín Anguiano and Maria Felix collaborated to create this year’s massive ofrenda installation, which will take more than a week to assemble.</p>



<p>“The Mexican Cultural Center couldn’t ask for a better partner for this event than the Penn Museum. Their dedication, expertise, and passion for our shared vision on culture have significantly enhanced our ability to achieve our goals and make a meaningful impact,” Guenther adds.</p>



<p>The Penn Museum’s&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.penn.museum/on-view/galleries-exhibitions/mexico-central-america-gallery">Mexico and Central America Gallery</a></strong>&nbsp;explores the stories of powerful ancient societies, including the Maya, Aztec, and Zapotec, while welcoming visitors to learn more about the traditions of people living in Mexico and Central America today.</p>



<p>The event is also supported by the&nbsp;<a href="https://clals.sas.upenn.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Center for Latin American and Latinx Studies</a>&nbsp;at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>All&nbsp;<em>CultureFest!&nbsp;<strong>Día de los Muertos</strong></em>&nbsp;activities are included with Penn Museum admission, and the entire line-up can be found&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.penn.museum/calendar/356/culturefest">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>NBC10 and Telemundo62 announced its annual <a href="https://www.cleartheshelters.com/"><em>Clear The Shelters</em></a> pet adoption and donation campaign will return for its milestone tenth consecutive year from Aug. 10 to Sept.10. As part of the monthlong event, NBC10 and Telemundo62 is partnering with local animal shelters and rescues to promote pet adoption and raise funds participating shelters and rescues. </p>



<p>Since its inception in 2015, NBC10 and Telemundo62’s local <a><em>Clear The Shelters</em> </a>campaigns have helped more than 42,000 pets find new homes. Nationally, more than one million pets have been adopted and millions of dollars has been raised for participating shelters and rescues over nine <em>Clear The Shelters</em> campaigns.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to celebrate a decade of community and compassion through our Clear the Shelters campaign,” said Ric Harris, President and General Manager of NBC10, Telemundo62 and NBC Sports Philadelphia. “Over the past 10 years, this initiative has helped countless animals find their <em>fur-ever</em> homes while also deepening our ties to local shelters and rescues in our community.”</p>



<p>The 2024 fundraising effort will again be led by Greater Good Charities, a global nonprofit and longtime campaign partner. Donations can be made Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 at <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/Users/206100180/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/RK6KNMMM/ClearTheSheltersFund.org">ClearTheSheltersFund.org</a>. Through the online platform, built by Fundraise Up, donors have the option to cover transaction fees so that 100 percent of the funds go directly to the shelter or rescue of their choice. </p>



<p>Virtual pet adoptions are also returning for the sixth consecutive campaign through <a href="https://werescue.pet/">WeRescue</a>. The WeRescue website and app enable users to browse adoptable pets in their area by breed, gender, size and other factors, submit their adoption applications, and ask questions directly to shelters.</p>

<p>Being a Resource Parent can be a challenging experience, especially for those new to it. Many children in foster care have gone through traumatic experiences that can have a lasting impact on their emotional and psychological well-being. The Foster Care Program at Concilio is dedicated to finding safe and loving homes for children in Philadelphia&#8217;s foster care system. We achieve this by recruiting, assessing, and training high-quality community members interested in becoming certified foster parents. Our resource parents provide temporary homes for children and play a vital role in supporting and mentoring biological families to promote reunification efforts.</p>



<p>Our support includes promoting activities that encourage reunification, such as visitation and enhanced communication with biological families throughout the child&#8217;s stay in the foster care system. If children are unable to be reunified with their biological parents, our adoption services unit will work to ensure a permanent home by exploring other permanency options.</p>



<p>Concilio trains its Resource Parents extensively on a wide range of topics to help them support a new family member’s transition. Each parent undergoes a minimum of 12 hours and up to 30 hours of training, depending on the level of children they are willing to accept. In addition, Concilio provides 24 hours of on-call support for resource parents to deal with emergencies. Concilio collaborates with various local and county agencies that refer children and families needing out-of-home placement.</p>



<p>To learn more about the program and find personalized information, you can contact Concilio&#8217;s hotline at <strong>215-627-3100</strong>. You can find additional resources and information about the program, including eligibility requirements and the application process on their website at <a href="https://www.elconcilio.net/"><strong>www.elconcilio.net</strong></a>. Concilio is committed to helping children in need and ensuring that all resource parents receive the necessary support and training to provide the best possible care. If you&#8217;re interested in making a difference in a child&#8217;s life and becoming a resource parent, we encourage you to get in touch with Concilio today.</p>

<p>NBC10, Telemundo62 and the&nbsp;Comcast&nbsp;NBCUniversal Foundation announced that seven local&nbsp;nonprofits&nbsp;will receive a total of $225,000 in unrestricted “NBCUniversal Local Impact Grants.” The winning organizations&nbsp;are addressing the needs of their diverse local communities through the lenses of one of three grant categories, Next Generation Storytellers, Youth Education &amp; Empowerment, and Community Engagement.</p>



<p>“NBC10 and Telemundo62 are proud to recognize the outstanding work of seven local non-profit organizations with unrestricted funding from the NBCUniversal Local Impact Grants,” said Ric Harris, President and General Manager of NBC Local Philadelphia. “We are committed to responding to the needs of our community. Each of these seven grant recipients are helping to make a meaningful impact in the communities we serve, which ultimately helps us build stronger communities.”</p>



<p>Early this year, NBC10, Telemundo62 and the&nbsp;Comcast&nbsp;NBCUniversal Foundation announced the rebranding of their grant program from &#8220;Project Innovation&#8221; to &#8220;NBCUniversal Local Impact Grants,&#8221; reflecting its local grassroots focus.</p>



<p><strong>NBCUniversal Local Impact Grant recipients include</strong>:  &nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-8 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p><a href="http://www.acementorphilly.org"><strong>ACE Mentor Program of Greater Philadelphia</strong></a><strong> &#8211; $40,000</strong>                                                                                             </p>



<p>ACE Mentor Program of Greater Philadelphia supports high school students pursuing careers in architecture (A), construction (C), and engineering (E) by providing after school programs tailored to mentor, and to support their continuing advancement within the different industries with scholarships, internships, and grants. The NBCUniversal Local Impact Grant will help increase community reach allowing ACE students to engage in the full scope of the design and construction process by having them work on real life projects reflecting the needs of the Philadelphia community. This will provide students with the ability to tap into their creativity and work collaboratively and offer them material kits for projects-based learning activities.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-9 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p><a href="http://www.actingwithoutboundaries.org"><strong>Acting Without Boundaries</strong></a><strong> &#8211; $30,000</strong>                                                                                                                           </p>



<p>Acting without Boundaries provides opportunities to the marginalized population of people with disabilities through performing arts programs that teaches performing arts skills, builds confidence on stage and beyond, creates a community of support for people with physical disabilities and their families allowing them to give back to the community through disability educational programs, performances, and presentations, and provides a center stage, promotes access, equity, and inclusion to ensure that the next generation of storytellers include a diverse range of voices and perspectives. The NBCUniversal Local Impact Grants will help create two high quality videos and one short film that will showcase the talents and experiences of individuals with physical disabilities challenging the stereotypes, misunderstandings, and misconceptions of individuals with physical disabilities to promote a more inclusive society.</p>

<p>Immigration Law &amp; Justice of the Delaware Valley supports refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants to escape violence, pursue legal status and unify families by providing exceptional immigration legal services such as learning about their rights, getting oriented to the U.S immigration system, and having one-on-one consultations with a legal professional with the possibility of offering to represent clients in their proceedings with the U.S Customs and Immigration Services and the Federal Immigration courts. The NBCUniversal Local Impact Grant will help support their legal staff to help prepare asylum applications and will represent at least 10 asylum-seekers in immigration court.</p>

<p>Rock to the Future supports positive youth development and economic empowerment through free, student-driven music programs for Philadelphia youth, serving hundreds of students annually in-school, after school, and during the summer in schools, community locations, and juvenile justice facilities. The NBCUniversal Local Impact Grant will help them bring transformative programs to more youth in the justice system and in neighborhoods impacted by poverty and violence by providing more access with additional service locations, reducing violence by providing more anti-violence and conflict resolution trainings, providing additional paid workforce and skill development opportunities, and increase overall well-being.</p>

<p>Trenton Music Makers, Inc. promotes access to music education for young people with a passion for music.

<p>Unemployment Information Center serves low-income people in the Philadelphia area through with services to help them push forward through difficult periods of unemployment, recession, and poverty without disastrous economic consequences. The NBCUniversal Local Impact Grant will help fund their staff so they can continue to assist unemployed workers caught in the breakdown of the PA unemployment compensation systems which has been in a crisis since the onset of the pandemic. With more funding they will be better equipped to help more individuals and get their information to the Department of Labor and Industry to facilitate their unemployment compensation.</p>

<p>Explore the unique history, traditions, and expressions of this celebration of life and death. Learn about the&nbsp;<em>ofrendas</em>&nbsp;(offerings) at the center of the festivities. The Mexican Cultural Center’s&nbsp;<em>ofrenda</em>&nbsp;is the creation of artist Ignacio Bernal. These ornate and colorful altars honor the dead (and encourage them to join the party!) with bright yellow marigolds, food, drinks, and photos.</p>



<p>Spanning more than 3,000 years of history, the Penn Museum’s Mexico and Central America Gallery explores the stories of powerful ancient civilizations including the Maya, Aztec, and Zapotec, while welcoming visitors to learn more about the traditions of people living in Mexico and Central America today.</p>

<p>Comcast announced that a new round of 100 businesses in Philadelphia will be selected to receive comprehensive grant packages that include business consultation services, educational resources, a $5,000 monetary grant, creative production, media schedule, and a technology makeover. <a href="https://www.comcastrise.com/">Comcast RISE</a>&nbsp;is committed to supporting the growth of all small businesses, while advancing the objectives of diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as community investment. The program was created in 2020 to help businesses and their communities thrive with a focus on economic growth.</p>



<p>Beginning on June 1, and through June 30, eligible businesses in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Detroit, Memphis and Portland, can apply for a grant package at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.comcastrise.com/">www.ComcastRISE.com</a>.</p>



<p>A total of 100 grants per city, or 500 grants overall, will be announced in August and awarded in September 2023, bringing the total number of recipients to date to 13,500, including 200 Philadelphia small businesses that received $2 million in grant awards and nearly 400 that received marketing or technology services packages shortly after the start of the pandemic.</p>



<p>“Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and are essential to building strong and thriving local communities,” said Loren Hudson, SVP and Chief Diversity Officer at Comcast. “As small businesses transition from pandemic recovery to a focus on expansion and growth, Comcast RISE is proud to help strengthen and empower these deserving businesses and entrepreneurs.”</p>



<p>Comcast RISE stands for Representation, Investment, Strength and Empowerment. Comcast RISE was created in November 2020 to help small businesses hardest hit by COVID-19, from bakeries and barber shops to childcare centers and cleaning services, by providing the grants needed to survive and recover. The program will evolve from helping businesses survive the pandemic, to helping businesses and their communities thrive with a focus on economic growth.</p>



<p>Renee Harris, CEO of STEM Prep Academy, an independent pre-school and Kindergarten with a mission to expose early learners to STEM education, received a Comcast RISE Investment Fund Grant in 2022.</p>



<p>“The last couple of years have been unsettling,” she said. “We had to close our doors and learn to operate in a new-normal just like every other school. The Comcast RISE Investment Fund grant was a lifesaver. It went directly to paying our dedicated staff who work so hard for our families.”</p>



<p>“Comcast is committed to taking tangible actions that drive long-term impact and change,” said Dan Bonelli, Senior Vice President, Comcast’s Freedom Region. “Comcast RISE helps small businesses grow, create jobs, and play a vital role in supporting our communities. This new round of Comcast RISE grant packages provides all the elements necessary to help businesses scale and thrive for years to come.”</p>



<p>Grant packages will include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>CONSULTATION:&nbsp;</strong>Assessment of business and tactical planning; business to business coaching; and mentorship to advise on how to grow business.</li>



<li><strong>EDUCATION RESOURCES:&nbsp;</strong>Educational content and resources tailored to individual companies based on where they are in their business lifecycle.</li>



<li><strong>MONETARY GRANT:&nbsp;</strong>$5,000 monetary grant to invest in growth and sustainability.</li>



<li><strong>CREATIVE PRODUCTION &amp; MEDIA:&nbsp;</strong>Turnkey production of a 30-second TV commercial, plus a media strategy consultation and 180-day media placement schedule.</li>



<li><strong>TECHNOLOGY MAKEOVER:&nbsp;</strong>Computer equipment and Internet, Voice and Cybersecurity services for 12 months. (Taxes and other fees may still apply for tech makeover services.)</li>
</ul>



<p>Through the Comcast RISE program, all recipients will receive a monthly newsletter with educational content. Additionally, any small business owner can visit the Comcast RISE destination on the X1 platform featuring aggregated small business news, tips, insights, and more. Just say “Comcast RISE” into the X1 voice remote.</p>



<p>Comcast RISE is part of&nbsp;<a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/impact/project-up">Project UP</a>, the company’s comprehensive initiative to advance digital equity and help build a future of unlimited possibilities. More information on eligibility requirements and how to apply for the grant program are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.comcastrise.com/">www.ComcastRISE.com</a>.</p>

<p>Concilio’s Resource Parent Program finds temporary safe homes for children in Philadelphia’s foster care system through the recruitment, assessment, and training of quality community members who solicit to become certified foster parents.</p>



<p>This program provides supportive mentoring for the biological families, promoting reunification efforts, such as visitation and enhanced communication with biological families throughout the child’s time in the foster care system.</p>



<p>Concilio differentiates from other foster care services in our region by being one of the few that can recruit Spanish speaking parents. Concilio is a non-profit that provides all required training a Resource Parent needs to get certified, in Spanish, so there is no language barrier.</p>



<p>Resource Parents not only receive personal gratification for taking on this life-changing task, but those that apply through Concilio benefit from receiving proper training, resources for childcare and a designated stipend to help cover the costs of raising a child.</p>



<p>People interested in becoming a Resource Parent must provide proof of citizenship, proof of residency, proof of income, background check, child abuse and FBI clearance, plus pass an interview and complete foster parent training.</p>



<p>For more information on how to participate, please call 215-627-3100, extension 247.</p>

They can also be spaces for dialogue, engagement, and activism, starting with climate change,” says Jennifer Brehm, Director of Learning &amp; Community Engagement at the Penn Museum. “<em>Seeds of Change</em> is a way for us to examine our historical roots to cultivate a better future.”</p>

<p>NBC10 Philadelphia (WCAU-TV) announced that Fred Shropshire will join the news team as anchor weekday evenings. He starts on Monday, June 26.</p>



<p>“We are excited to have Fred join the NBC10 family,” said Elizabeth Flores, Vice President of News for NBC10 and Telemundo62. “He is a dedicated and community-minded journalist, whose knowledge and passion for storytelling will serve our audience well.”</p>



<p>Shropshire comes to NBC10 from WCNC-TV, the NBC affiliate in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he served as weekday evening anchor. Prior to that, he was at WTVD-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he anchored the 4 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. newscasts. He conducted more than a dozen sit-down interviews with then-Senator Barack Obama during his first historic presidential run for the White House. Shropshire’s career began at WCTI-TV in New Bern, North Carolina, and includes stints at WXII-TV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and WGN-TV in Chicago. He has also chased several tropical storms including Hurricane Ike when it made landfall in Galveston, Texas.</p>



<p>“As a self-proclaimed history buff, I’m looking forward to learning more about Philadelphia, one of the country’s oldest cities,” said Shropshire. “It will be fun for my family and me to explore all that the Delaware Valley has to offer.”</p>



<p>Shropshire graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill where he obtained a bachelor’s degree in journalism. He is a member of the National Association of Black Journalists and in 2006, was honored as a distinguished Nelson Benton Lecturer for UNC at Chapel Hill Journalism School. He has been recognized with an RTDNA award, regional Edward R. Murrow awards and regional Emmy awards for his anchoring and reporting.</p>

<p>On <strong>Saturday, March 11</strong>, the <a href="https://www.penn.museum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Penn Museum</a> will honor the artistic power of women visionaries from around the world with <em>CultureFest!</em> The event will go from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm.</p>



<p>Featuring live performances, storytelling, make-and-take art activities, hands-on workshops, pottery wheel demonstrations, plus a marketplace filled with the one-of-a-kind works from local ceramic and print artists, the March <em>CultureFest!</em> showcases the often-overlooked contributions of movers and shakers across cultures and communities throughout history. The daylong festival includes:</p>



<p>10:30 am – Women’s Sekere Ensemble in Pepper Hall, preserving West African traditional music</p>



<p>11:00 am – Sattriya Dance Company in Harrison Auditorium</p>



<p>11:45 am – Drag Queen Storytime with Eric Jaffee in the Sphinx Gallery (also at 3:15 pm)</p>



<p>1:00 pm – Choral Performance celebrating the power of women by Sister Cities GirlChoir and award-winning soprano Miss Jillian Pirtle, and debut of “A Woman’s Voice”, a collaboration between the two organizations</p>



<p>2:00 pm – Vervet Dance contemporary dance performance in Widener Lecture Hall</p>



<p>The Penn Museum’s partnership with Miss Jillian Pirtle, award-winning soprano and CEO of the National Marian Anderson Museum &amp; Historical Society, began in 2019 ahead of The Stories We Wear exhibition. During <em>CultureFest!</em> , Pirtle and the Sister Cities GirlChoir, will premiere their original composition, “A Woman’s Voice,” which highlights the exceptional power, determination, and beauty of women and their voices.</p>



<p>“Collaborating with the young talent in Sister Cities GirlChoir has given both organizations a<br>chance to create art and be inspired by each other,” explains Pirtle, who takes pride in teaching the next generation about Marian Anderson’s enduring legacy. “This performance gives a whole new meaning appreciating women in society. It means seeing us as artists and leaders. By working with young girls to have their voices, opinions, and musical styles heard, we are honoring women’s ideas, goals, dreams, and visions. This is what history should inspire us to do differently as we move forward.”</p>



<p>Another community partner, Sattriya Dance Company, will share a 500-year-old ritualistic dance that originated in the monasteries of Assam in India. Traditionally, it was performed by men. Today, it shares messages of peace, equality, love, and universal brotherhood.</p>



<p>“As a tradition bearer of an art form that lived for centuries in male bodies, I am deeply aware of the profound honor and responsibility that lies in me to carry this legacy forward in a respectful and meaningful way,” Madhusmita Bora, a native practitioner of Sattriya, says.</p>



<p>Other partners for <em>CultureFest!</em> include the University City Arts League, a non-profit organization<br>dedicated to intergenerational education and cultural enrichment through the arts, and Caldera,<br>which helps to build a thriving ethical creative ecosystem for BIPOC and Queer creative</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">The full line-up for <em>CultureFest!</em> Celebrate Women Artists and Creatives can be found <strong><a href="https://www.penn.museum/calendar/1365/celebrate-women-artists-and-creatives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></strong>, and all activities are included with Museum admission.</h2>

<p>As a proud sponsor of the African American Children’s Book Fair, NBC10 and Telemundo62 donated books from the guest authors and illustrators that were presenting at the event, helping to ensure that every child could leave with a book at no charge. A wide selection of literature for all ages were made accessible, from preschool to young adult.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>In partnership with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mexicanculturalcenter.org/" target="_blank">Mexican Cultural Center</a>, the <a href="https://www.consularcorpsofphiladelphia.org/mexico/">Mexican</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.consularcorpsofphiladelphia.org/mexico/" target="_blank">Consulate in Philadelphia</a>, and Norristown’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bfyaretzi/">Ballet </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/bfyaretzi/" target="_blank">Folklorico</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bfyaretzi/"> Yaretzi</a>, the Penn Museum will showcase Mexico’s vibrant traditions with the 11th annual <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.penn.museum/calendar/1354/culturefest-dia-de-los-muertos" target="_blank">CultureFest</a><a href="https://www.penn.museum/calendar/1354/culturefest-dia-de-los-muertos">!</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.penn.museum/calendar/1354/culturefest-dia-de-los-muertos" target="_blank">Día de los Muertos</a></strong>, on Saturday, October 29 from 10am to 4pm.</p>



<p>Blending Indigenous Mexican beliefs with the Catholic celebrations of All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day, Día de los Muertos is observed in Latino communities around the world and traces its roots back 3,000 years to pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.</p>



<p><strong>CultureFest! Día de los Muertos</strong>, or Day of the Dead, will introduce everyone to the celebration’s unique traditions, such as the iconic smiling calacas y calaveras (skeletons and skulls) that appear on candy, masks, and dolls, as well as in movies like Disney’s Coco. This all-day festival will feature an artisan market and make-and-take activities, along with live performances:</p>



<ul><li>11:00AM &#8211; Eve Morales, la voz con sentimiento (the voice with sentiment)</li><li>11:30AM &#8211; <em>Day</em>, Día de los Muertos musical performance honoring Jenny Rivera, Joan Sebastian, and Selena Quintanilla</li><li>1:00PM &#8211; Dance presentation by Ballet Folklorico Yaretzi</li><li>1:30PM &#8211; <em>Day</em>, Día de los Muertos musical performance honoring Juan Gabriel, Chavela Vargas, and Vicente Fernández</li><li>2:45PM &#8211; Eve Morales, la voz con sentimiento (the voice with sentiment)</li></ul>



<p>“The Mexican Cultural Center’s mission is to promote Mexican culture, arts, and traditions through events such as the ‘Day of the Dead,’ to share all of the wonders that Mexico and its people have to offer. The Penn Museum has become one of our most-cherished partnerships,“ says Ivette Compean Rodriguez, Executive Director of the Mexican Cultural Center. “Like us, they believe in educating others on diversity, culture, and much more.”</p>



<p>The event’s centerpiece is a monumental ofrenda—a colorful, elaborate communal altar that honors those who have passed. Created by artists Julieta Zavala and Mauro Carrera, this art installation to be displayed in the Egypt Galleries will be dedicated to Jenny Rivera, Joan Sebastian, Selena Quintanilla, Juan Gabriel, Chavela Vargas, and Vicente Fernández—all singers-songwriters from Mexico or of Mexican descent who have passed.</p>



<p>The annual <strong>CultureFest! Día de los Muertos</strong> community altar contest invites individuals, organizations, universities, and companies to create-their-own ofrendas. Altars must respect the traditional Mexican format and be completed before the event. Anyone interested in participating in the contest can contact 215-845-5004 or e-mail <a href="mailto:admin@mexicanculturalcenter.org">admin@mexicanculturalcenter.org.</a></p>

<p>In addition, free samples of “Pan de Muerto” (Day of the Dead bread) and Mexican hot chocolate will be served at 12:45 p.m. in the Rotunda.</p>



<p>Spanning more than 3,000 years of history, the Penn Museum’s Mexico and Central America Gallery explores the stories of powerful ancient civilizations including the Maya, Aztec, and Zapotec, while welcoming visitors to learn more about the traditions of people living in Mexico and Central America today.</p>



<p>All CultureFest! Día de los Muertos activities are included with Museum admission. The entire line-up for the day’s events can be found <a href="https://www.penn.museum/calendar/1354/culturefest-dia-de-los-muertos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://givetovirtua.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virtua Health Foundation</a> is being awarded a $30,000 grant from NBC10, Telemundo62, and the Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation as a part of the Project Innovation Grant Challenge. This grant will go towards supporting their Eat Well Mobile Grocery Store.</p>



<p>The Eat Well Mobile Grocery Store offers fresh, nutritious food at below-market prices to communities in areas known as “food deserts”- an urban area in which it is difficult to buy affordable or good-quality fresh food. This grocery store on-wheels began in February 2021. They operate in Burlington County, Camden County, and Gloucester County. In order to get this food to the communities who need it most, NJ transit donated a 40-foot bus that was then converted into a one-aisle grocery store on wheels, fully stocked with shelves, coolers, and freezers. The bus is wheel-chair accessible and ran by a friendly, welcoming staff. Customers also have the opportunity to speak with a dietitian for information about a healthy diet, as well as recipes they can prepare with the food they buy. </p>

<p>The Virtua team recognizes that food is medicine&#8211; a person can&#8217;t reach their full potential if they don&#8217;t know where their next meal is coming from. Knowing how fundamental proper nutrition is, the Eat Well Mobile Grocery Store is accessible year-round. Members of these communities can always rely on this program for healthy foods and a dignified shopping experience.</p>



<p>Coming up in the Fall, Virtua Health will be doing their Annual Turkey and Produce Giveaway for Thanksgiving. Over 1000 turkeys and bags of produces are given out over the course of two days, as well as healthy recipes to go along. The program was started in 2016 and this year the giveaway will be expanded to their Eat Well Mobile customers. </p>



<p>Virtua Health Foundation is the nonprofit arm of Virtua Health, a nonprofit health system and one of the region&#8217;s largest employers. They deliver care at five hospitals and 300 medical practices and facilities. With the support from community organizations, grant funders, and corporate partners, Virtua Health is able to put a major focus on their community health programs. In 2021, they brought in more than $10 million dollars to help support programs like the Eat Well Mobile Grocery Store, as well as their Eat Well Food Pharmacies, Mobile Pediatric Program, and more. </p>

<p>A professional theatre company based in Norristown, Montgomery County, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theatrehorizon.org/" target="_blank">Theatre Horizon</a>, has been awarded a $25,000 grant from NBC10, Telemundo62, and Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation as part of Project Innovation. The money will go towards the theatre’s Autism Drama Program, whose mission is to help inspire imagination and social development for individuals on the autism spectrum.</p>



<p>Founded in 2005 by Erin Reilly and Matthew Decker, Theater Horizon&#8217;s mission is to use the transformative power of storytelling to foster empathy and to create an inclusive home for artists, audiences, and students alike. Over the past 17 years, the theatre has been recognized with Barrymore awards and notable acclaim in the NY Times. They offer multiple educational programs including NStep, after school drama clubs, summer camps, private and small group lessons, and their Autism Drama Program. They have Spanish speaking drama sites and provide an experience of belonging to everyone, including those who have never been exposed to theater. Thanks to funding from individual donors and foundations, Theatre Horizon is able to offer these programs on a sliding scale tuition so families can pay what they can afford and these programs are accessible to all.</p>

<p>The Autism Drama Program began when the company did 17 years ago and is a core part of the organization. These classes help students on the Autism spectrum develop social skills, verbal expression, empathy for others, and a sense of self-worth and accomplishment. They celebrate unique and individual genius while creating a safe space for neuro-divergent people to connect, build self confidence, and creatively express themselves. The program started out with just one student and has grown to serve more than 1,000 students. </p>

<p>During the pandemic, Theatre Horizon moved this program online and were then able to reach students who live out-of-state and even internationally! The organization will use this grant money to be able to continue and expand upon having both virtual and in-person options. This allows them to continue to reach out-of-state and international students, as well as provide the virtual option for the students who feel more comfortable learning that way. They also plan to double the number of teaching artists and curate new classes.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ymwicfoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Young Men and Women in Charge Foundation</a> (YMWIC) has been awarded a $35,000 grant from NBC10, Telemundo62, and Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation as a part of the Project Innovation Grant Challenge. This grant will help fund the organization&#8217;s Summer STEAM camp program, which aims for underserved youth to have fun with science and prepare them for future careers in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Agriculture, and Math). Kids are immersed in fun, hands-on activities from robotics to trips to the Franklin Institute and the zoo. The Summer STEAM camp program runs from June through July and in 2022 had seven school districts participating. YMWIC hopes by making science and math fun, more of these kids will pursue careers in STEAM and increase diversity in this underrepresented space. </p>



<p>Founder of YMWIC, Richard Roberts III, studied engineering at Widener University. During his time there, he saw that there was not many young men of color in his program of study. This experience eventually led Richard to give up his career in engineering to start this organization. YMWIC’s&nbsp;mission<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is to empower and prepare economically disadvantaged and historically underrepresented youth to excel and become leaders in STEM careers through academic tutoring, mentoring and financial assistance programs, accomplished by leveraging alliances with K-12 school districts, universities, corporations, and the Foundation’s committed partners.&nbsp;They currently have partnerships with 8 school districts: Chester Upland, Coatesville, Norristown, Phoenixville, Philadelphia, Upper Darby, West Chester, and William Penn. This organization started off serving 19 young men and are now serving over 500 kids a year, boys and girls, and growing. </p>



<p><strong>Click <a href="https://ymwicfoundation.org/student-form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> if you&#8217;re interested in joining YMWIC. </strong></p>



<p>As a wrap-around program, this organization provides more than just academic support. Many of the kids have challenges beyond classwork like food insecurity and family issues. YMWIC offers financial assistance and more to help these kids survive and be able to prioritize their academics. </p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cwfphilly.org/" target="_blank">Campaign for Working Families</a> (CWF)  is a 2022 Project Innovation grant recipient of $50,000 from NBC10, Telemundo62, and Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation. This funding will go towards their program for Advancing Equity through Youth Empowerment and Community Engagement.</p>



<p>CWF was created in 2003 with the goal of helping working families in the Greater Philadelphia region move up the economic ladder. For nearly two decades they have been committed to helping families and individuals achieve economic empowerment by providing free tax preparation, resource building, and asset development. This support and guidance allows low-income households to plan for financially secure futures. Last year they did 28,000 federal returns and this year they are close to 24,000 returns. They receive a huge volume of tax returns but have a small staff, so they had around 600 to 700 volunteers who go through IRS-certified training. Their goal is to get $50 million in refunds back to the community. They partner with other organizations like Philabundance and the IRS Tax Advocacy Division to ensure people can get the help they need and are aware of all benefits they are eligible for. Some of these benefits include SNAP, LIHEAP, credit counseling, property tax rebates, and senior services.  </p>







<p>Their <strong><a href="https://www.cwfphilly.org/about/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">services</a></strong> include: </p>



<ul><li>Free Tax Preparation and Asset Building</li><li>Mobile Tax Operation</li><li>Assisted Self Tax-Preparation</li><li>Financial Services and Saving Products</li><li>Advocacy and Organizing</li><li>Community Workshops.</li></ul>



<p>Click <a href="https://www.cwfphilly.org/appointment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>here</strong></a> to schedule a free appointment today.</p>







<p>Their program for Advancing Equity through Youth Empowerment and Community Engagement started as a partnership with Martin Luther King High School. They worked with these students for four consecutive years, training them to run a tax site out of the school. Currently, they are working with Lincoln High School and continuing to train students to do taxes. The training time frame is from October to January and all the students become IRS certified. The students also have all their work quality-reviewed by an experienced staff member. Students walk away with customer service skills, digital technology skills, knowledge of tax law, and are able to bring this knowledge home to their families and their community, as well as into future careers. Last year they had 15-20 students participating and are hoping to double that amount for this year.</p>



<p>During the pandemic, CWF had to stop the programs from being run inside the schools; As a result, they switched to a virtual platform where community members could drop off their documents and be contacted once the return was completed, and also offered the ability to upload all their documents straight to the virtual platform themselves. </p>



<p>With the funding from this Project Innovation grant, CWF will be able to run these tax sites from inside the high schools again, and also expand into other high schools, getting this program off the ground and furthering their impact in the community.  This grant will also allow them to now stipend the students as a part of a matched savings account which will offer them more motivation to get involved. </p>

<p>The<a href="https://www.thecenterblacked.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong> </strong></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thecenterblacked.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Center for Black Educator Development</strong> </a>has received a $74,000 grant from NBC10, Telemundo62, and Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation as a part of Project Innovation. This funding will go towards their Freedom Schools Literacy Academy.</p>



<p>The Freedom Literacy Schools Academy (FLSA) is a 5-week program for aspiring Black high school and college students to teach literacy skills and Project Based Learning to rising 1st through 3rd grade students. They are provided with mentorship, professional development, and in-classroom teaching experience. They have in-person sites in Philadelphia, Camden, and Detroit, as well as virtual sites. The funding from the Project Innovation grant will go towards expanding this program and being able to engage more high school and college youth in teaching. </p>











<p>Center for Black Educator Development was launched in June 2019 with the mission of rebuilding the national black teacher pipeline. By dramatically increasing the number of Black educators, low-income Black and minority students will greatly benefit from having educators that they share a cultural background and the same socio-political interests with. As stated on their site, having at least one Black teacher early on reduces a Black student’s likelihood of dropping out of school by up to 39 percent. The Center recruits talented young men and women of high school and college age, as well as people seeking career changes. </p>
