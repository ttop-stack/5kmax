<ul> <li>Elon Musk endorsed Germany&#8217;s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in a post on X Thursday night.</li> <li>&#8220;Only the AfD can save Germany,&#8221; Musk wrote.</li> <li>Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), slammed Musk and said the billionaire &#8220;enthusiastically supports the neo-Nazi party in Germany.&#8221;</li></ul>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078856">Tesla</a> CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, a meagdonor and adviser to President-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, is now seeking to influence Germany&#8217;s election, posting an endorsement on X of the country&#8217;s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1869986946031988780">post</a> Thursday night, Musk wrote, &#8220;Only the AfD can save Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>Musk, who has over 200 million listed followers on the site that he owns, made the comment while sharing a post from far-right influencer, Naomi Seibt, who claimed that Germany&#8217;s &#8220;presumptive next chancellor Friedrich Merz (CDU) is horrified by the idea that Germany should follow Elon Musk&#8217;s and Javier Milei&#8217;s example,&#8221; referring to the president of Argentina.</p>

<div class="cnbc-social-embed"> <blockquote class="embed-container twitter-tweet"><a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1869986946031988780"></a> </blockquote> </div>

<p>Seibt has a history of promoting white nationalist ideology, The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/28/naomi-seibt-anti-greta-activist-white-nationalist-inspiration">previously reported</a>, and has denied the validity of <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/scientific-consensus/">scientific consensus</a> around climate change, namely that it&#8217;s driven by fossil fuel emissions.</p>

<p>In a post on X, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called Musk an &#8220;out of touch billionaire running the incoming Trump Administration&#8221; who &#8220;enthusiastically supports the neo-Nazi party in Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The AfD&#8217;s mission is to rehabilitate the image of the Nazi movement,&#8221; Murphy wrote. He added that one of the party&#8217;s leaders has a license plate that&#8217;s &#8220;an open tribute to Hitler,&#8221; and another &#8220;described Judaism as the &#8216;inner enemy&#8217; in Germany.&#8221;</p>

<div class="cnbc-social-embed"> <blockquote class="embed-container twitter-tweet"><a href="https://x.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1870123774332322055"></a> </blockquote> </div>

<p>Musk and Tesla&#8217;s investor relations team didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>On Friday, German <a href="https://apnews.com/article/germany-scholz-confidence-vote-parliament-election-87c6c0c64726eefaa95d9c46dae611dc">Chancellor Olaf Scholz</a>, a center-left Social Democrat, dismissed Musk&#8217;s claim that only the far-right party can &#8220;save Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under Scholz&#8217;s leadership, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/germany-faces-sudden-turmoil-ruling-coalition-collapses-rcna179078">Germany</a>&#8216;s left-wing coalition collapsed in November, and AfD is currently polling in second place ahead of February elections. Throughout Germany, where the AfD has placed highly in state elections, the other parties have generally refused to form coalitions with it. </p>

<p>According to Pew Research, &#8220;AfD has campaigned <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/germany-ukraine-afd-election-1947568">against weapon deliveries</a> to Ukraine and called for an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/world/europe/germany-afd-russia.html">end to sanctions</a> on Russia,&#8221; a view shared by Musk.</p>

<p>Far right parties have also gained ground in the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and elsewhere. Many cheered Trump&#8217;s election, which Musk helped finance through $277 million in contributions to the campaign and related Republican causes.</p>

<p>Tesla&#8217;s stock is up about 75% since Trump&#8217;s victory, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/tesla-reaches-record-boosted-by-64percent-pop-since-trump-election-victory.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078856">surpassing</a> its prior all-time high from 2021 last week.</p>

<p>AfD has <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/elon-musk-and-germanys-far-right-share-complex-relationship/a-68565717">reportedly</a> criticized Tesla and its factory outside of Berlin. The party claimed many of Tesla&#8217;s thousands of workers there commute in from Poland or Berlin, limiting the economic benefits to the local community in Brandeburg.</p>

<p>The AfD generally views electric vehicles as part of an ideological climate movement, and not good for Germany&#8217;s auto industry.</p>

<p>Europe has been a tough market for Tesla this year. According to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, sales of Tesla cars declined 40.9% in November, exceeding the overall 9.5% dip in sales of battery electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Euopre, Musk endorsed right-wing Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and has voiced support for Nigel Farage in the U.K, a populist politician and head of Reform UK. In South America, Musk endorsed and has a friendship with Argentina&#8217;s President Milei, a self-described anarcho-capitalist.</p>

<ul> <li>Saving $1 million for retirement is often considered the gold standard and, for the first time, a larger share of younger retirement savers are reaching that key savings threshold.</li> <li>The number of millennials with more than $1 million in their 401(k)s has jumped 400% from one year ago, according to Fidelity.</li> <li>Positive market conditions helped boost account balances to new highs in 2024.</li></ul>

<iframe src="https://player.cnbc.com/p/gZWlPC/cnbc_global?playertype=synd&amp;autoplay=true&amp;byGuid=7000350690" class="cnbcplayer" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>A few years ago, Wes Bellamy, 38, took stock of his investment accounts in preparation to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/real-estate/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078261">buy a home</a> in Charlottesville, Virginia. It was then that he noticed significant gains in his <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/401k/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078261">401(k)</a>.</p>

<p>Although Bellamy, who is the chair of the political science department at Virginia State University, had been saving diligently for nearly a decade and making the most of his employer&#8217;s matching program, he said seeing his retirement account balance was &#8220;a pleasant surprise and a nice nest egg.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since then, his 401(k) balance has continued to grow. &#8220;I&#8217;m at $980,000 — I&#8217;m not at a million yet but I&#8217;m close.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">More millennials are 401(k) millionaires</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/to-retire-comfortably-35percent-of-workers-say-theyll-need-over-1-million.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078261">Saving $1 million</a> for retirement used to be considered the gold standard, although these days financial advisors may recommend putting away even more.</p>

<p>Millennial workers are still the most common generation to say they&#8217;ll need at least $1 million to retire comfortably, according to a recent report by <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/retirement-savings-survey/#estimated-need">Bankrate</a>, and, for the first time, a larger share of younger retirement savers are reaching that key savings threshold.</p>

<p>The number of millennials with seven-figure balances has jumped 400% from one year ago, according to the data from Fidelity Investments prepared for CNBC.</p>

<p>Among this group, the number of 401(k) accounts with <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/about-fidelity/Q3-2024-retirement-analysis">a balance of $1 million or more</a> rose to about 10,000 as of Sept. 30, up from around 2,000 in the third quarter of 2023, according to Fidelity, the nation&#8217;s largest provider of 401(k) plans. The financial services firm handles more than 49 million retirement accounts altogether.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/108076609-1734381523862-u6qib-millennial-401-k-millionaires-in-the-u-s-.png?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite></cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-text="" data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text"></span></span></div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Generally, reaching 401(k) millionaire status only comes after decades of consistent contributions, making it a harder milestone for younger workers to achieve.</p>

<p>This year, positive market conditions helped boost those account balances to new highs. The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NDAQ/">Nasdaq</a> is up 29% year to date, as of Dec. 19, while the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/">S&amp;P 500</a> notched a 23% gain and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> rose more than 12%.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even shorter-term savers have done well because of significant market gains,&#8221; said Mike Shamrell, Fidelity&#8217;s vice president of thought leadership.  </p>

<p>&#8220;If we continue to see positive market conditions, we could see not only the overall number of millionaires overall bump up over that threshold but also more millennials,&#8221; Shamrell said.</p>

<p>Whether savers benefit more from long-term savings efforts or a favorable investment environment, &#8220;the reality is, it&#8217;s a blend of both,&#8221; financial advisor Jordan Awoye, managing partner of Awoye Capital in New York, said.</p>

<p>Further, millennials — the oldest of whom will be 44 in 2025 — are nearing their peak earning years, he said, &#8220;which is making it more enticing to save for retirement.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>More from Personal Finance:</strong><br><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/17/higher-401k-limit-2025-update-your-account-now.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078261">There&#8217;s a higher 401(k) limit for 2025</a><br><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/17/why-new-retirees-may-need-to-rethink-the-4percent-rule.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078261">Why new retirees may need to rethink the 4% rule</a><br><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/16/reduce-your-2024-tax-bill-last-minute-moves.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078261">Slash your 2024 tax bill with these last-minute moves</a></p>

<p>Still, reaching the million-dollar mark &#8220;is not everything,&#8221; Awoye said.</p>

<p>Heading into a year of potential volatility, those balances will fluctuate, perhaps even dramatically. However, there is still plenty of time before millennial savers will need to access those funds in retirement. &#8220;You are likely not touching that money for 20 years. Even if [the market] goes up and down, stick to the script,&#8221; Awoye said.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you are retirement planning, you have to remember to tie it back to your North Star, which is your goal.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to become a 401(k) millionaire</h4>

<p>Certified financial planner Chelsea Ransom-Cooper, chief financial planning officer of Zenith Wealth Partners in New Jersey, works with mostly millennial clients. She says she often encourages them to contribute more than what&#8217;s necessary to get the full employer match — even up to the maximum annual contribution limits for a 401(k) or IRA.</p>

<p>In 2023, only 14% of employees <a href="https://institutional.vanguard.com/content/dam/inst/iig-transformation/insights/pdf/2024/has/how_america_saves_report_2024.pdf">deferred the maximum</a> annual amount into 401(k) plans, according to Vanguard&#8217;s 2024 How America Saves report. But that&#8217;s a missed opportunity, Ransom-Cooper said.</p>

<p>In 2025, employees can defer <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/401k-contribution-limits-2025.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078261">$23,500</a> into workplace plans, up from $23,000 in 2024. (The IRA contribution limit is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/ira-contribution-limits-2025.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078261">$7,000</a> for 2025, unchanged from 2024.)</p>

<p>At the same time, employer contributions are climbing. Together, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/average-401k-savings-rate.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078261">the average 401(k) savings rate</a>, including employee deferrals and company contributions, rose to 12.7% in 2023, up from 12.1% the year before, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America&#8217;s annual survey of 401(k) plans.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s made a big difference, Ransom-Cooper said. &#8220;There&#8217;s more money that can go into these accounts outside of the employee contribution, that can be really helpful to push these accounts higher and help people reach their retirement goals.&#8221;</p>

<iframe src="https://player.cnbc.com/p/gZWlPC/cnbc_global?playertype=synd&amp;autoplay=true&amp;byGuid=7000355854" class="cnbcplayer" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>While there is always the chance that a market downturn will take a toll on these balances in the year to come, the markets are up more than they are down, Ransom-Cooper said. &#8220;They can weather those tougher days in the shorter term.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Staying the course and keeping that longer term vision is really helpful,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Bellamy says his goal is to retire in another 20 years, before reaching 60. &#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll have another 15, 20 years to live my life freely as I want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>OpenAI&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://openai.com/12-days/">12 Days of Shipmas</a>,&#8221; which wrapped up on Friday, brought a sense of levity to end the year. The marketing blitz served as a way for the high-profile and controversial AI startup to show it can release an extensive roster of new features and tools while also having some fun.</p>

<p>But when the calendar turns, the company faces some serious challenges. Most notably, there&#8217;s co-founder <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, who now runs rival startup xAI, and is in the midst of a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/13/openai-says-elon-musk-wanted-it-to-be-for-profit-in-2017.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">heated legal battle</a> with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that could have a big impact on the company&#8217;s future.</p>

<p>The threat Musk poses to OpenAI is even more significant considering the hefty amount of influence the world&#8217;s richest person is poised to assume as part of the incoming Trump administration.</p>

<p>In recent months, Musk has sued <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">Microsoft</a>-backed OpenAI and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/30/elon-musk-asks-court-to-block-openai-from-converting-to-a-for-profit.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">asked a court</a> to stop the company from converting to a for-profit corporation from a nonprofit. In posts on X, he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1863117008319250754">described</a> that effort as a &#8220;total scam&#8221; and <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1841592690678317368">claimed</a> that &#8220;OpenAI is evil.&#8221; At The New York Times&#8217; DealBook Summit earlier this month, Altman <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">said</a> he views xAI as a &#8220;fierce competitor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pressure on OpenAI is tied in large part to its $157 billion valuation, achieved in the two years since the company launched its viral chatbot, ChatGPT, and kicked off the boom in generative AI. OpenAI <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/02/openai-raises-at-157-billion-valuation-microsoft-nvidia-join-round.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">closed its latest $6.6 billion round in October</a>, gearing up to aggressively compete with xAI as well as Microsoft, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">Amazon</a> and Anthropic in a market that&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/insights/data/generative-ai-races-toward-1-3-trillion-in-revenue-by-2032/#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20is%20poised%20to,our%20proprietary%20market%2Dsizing%20model.">predicted to top $1 trillion</a> in revenue within a decade.</p>

<p>Alongside the drama swirling around OpenAI and Altman, the Shipmas shtick served as a way for the company to shift the focus to its technology and generate buzz for its products.</p>

<p>The most significant release over the 12 days was the public launch of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/09/openai-releases-sora-its-buzzy-ai-video-generation-tool.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">Sora</a>, OpenAI&#8217;s much-hyped video-generation tool, on Dec. 9.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.cnbc.com/p/gZWlPC/cnbc_global?playertype=synd&amp;autoplay=true&amp;byGuid=7000360404" class="cnbcplayer" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Using Sora, which OpenAI first announced in February, is relatively simple: A user types out a desired scene, and the engine will return a high-definition video clip. Sora can also create clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. While other AI video tools are available, Sora has been by far the most anticipated because of the power of OpenAI&#8217;s large language models.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, OpenAI gave users a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/openai-makes-chatgpt-available-for-phone-chats.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">new way to talk to its viral chatbot</a>: 1-800-CHATGPT. Those in the U.S. can dial the number (1-800-242-8478) for 15 minutes free per month, OpenAI said, and WhatsApp users globally can message the chatbot at the same number.</p>

<p>Other announcements included the full release of OpenAI&#8217;s new o1 AI model focused on reasoning, a demo of video and screen-sharing options in ChatGPT&#8217;s Advanced Voice Mode, the ability to organize work into &#8220;Projects&#8221; within ChatGPT, a wider rollout of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/openai-launches-chatgpt-search-competing-with-google-and-perplexity.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">ChatGPT Search</a> and new developer tools. The company also used the marketing push to talk about its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/apple-launches-its-chatgpt-integration-with-siri.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">integration with Apple</a> for the iPhone, iPad and macOS.</p>

<p>OpenAI closed out its 12-day run of releases on Friday by announcing its newest frontier model, o3, as well as o3 mini. On a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKBG1sqdyIU">livestream</a>, Altman said the company would not publicly launch the models Friday but would make them immediately available for public safety testing.</p>

<p>The company launched o1 in September, and in skipping straight to o3, Altman said he&#8217;s continuing &#8220;the grand tradition of OpenAI being really, truly bad at names.&#8221;</p>

<p>The campaign was celebrated in some corners for the company&#8217;s ability to make a strong year-end push, and criticized by others as significantly more hype than substance. Either way, OpenAI is well aware that competition is heating up — and quickly.</p>

<p>One of its chief rivals, Amazon-backed Anthropic, was founded by early OpenAI researchers and has been attracting top talent. In May, OpenAI safety leader Jan Leike left OpenAI for Anthropic, and in August, OpenAI co-founder John Schulman announced he was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/06/openai-co-founder-john-schulman-says-he-will-join-rival-anthropic.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">leaving</a> to join the rival startup. They were part of a wave of departures that culminated in September, when <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/openai-cto-mira-murati-announces-shes-leaving-the-company.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">three top leaders</a>, most notably technology chief Mira Murati, announced their exits on the same day.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Microsoft tension</h4>

<p>A recent report by Anthropic investor Menlo Ventures found that OpenAI <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/20/business-spending-on-ai-surged-500percent-this-year-to-13point8-billion-says-menlo-ventures.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">ceded market share</a> this year in enterprise AI, declining from 50% to 34%, while Anthropic doubled its market share from 12% to 24%. The results came from a survey of 600 enterprise IT decision-makers from companies with 50 or more employees, according to the report.</p>

<p>One key area where the two companies appear poised to go head-to-head is in defense, as AI companies walk back earlier bans on military use of their products and enter into partnerships with big players in the industry and the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>

<p>The day before OpenAI&#8217;s Shipmas event began, the company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openai-partners-with-defense-company-anduril.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">announced a partnership with Anduril</a>, allowing the defense tech provider to deploy advanced AI systems for &#8220;national security missions.&#8221; Last month, Anthropic and defense software vendor <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PLTR&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">Palantir</a> announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to &#8220;provide U.S. intelligence and defense agencies access&#8221; to Anthropic&#8217;s AI systems.</p>

<p>The primary battle, though, is still for users. Altman <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">said publicly</a> earlier this month that OpenAI now has 300 million weekly active users. Over the next year, the company is reportedly <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e91cb018-873c-4388-84c0-46e9f82146b4">targeting 1 billion</a>.</p>

<p>That level of growth will likely require a pricey marketing push and fast-tracked feature launches, as the company advances in its two-year timeline for transitioning from a nonprofit into a fully for-profit company. Earlier this month, OpenAI announced it had hired <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/03/openai-hires-first-marketing-chief-from-coinbase.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">its first chief marketing officer</a>, nabbing Kate Rouch from crypto company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/COIN/">Coinbase</a>.</p>

<p>Then there&#8217;s the increasingly complicated relationship with Microsoft, OpenAI&#8217;s lead investor and key cloud provider. While both companies continue to tout the value of their close partnership, there are increasing signs of tension.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/107329682-1699299150834-gettyimages-1778708098-js2_4099_isifrhca.jpeg?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, right, speaks as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman looks on during the OpenAI DevDay event in San Francisco on Nov. 6, 2023." data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite>Justin Sullivan | Getty Images</cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-text="Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, right, speaks as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman looks on during the OpenAI DevDay event in San Francisco on Nov. 6, 2023." data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, right, speaks as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman looks on during the OpenAI DevDay event in San Francisco on Nov. 6, 2023.</span></span></div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Following Altman&#8217;s abrupt but short-lived ouster from OpenAI late last year, reports surfaced that Microsoft CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> was not briefed beforehand. After Altman was quickly reinstated, OpenAI gave Microsoft a non-voting board seat. Microsoft <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/microsoft-giving-up-openai-board-observer-seat-doesnt-settle-concerns.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">relinquished</a> the position in July.</p>

<p>In March, Nadella <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/19/microsoft-names-deepmind-co-founder-mustafa-suleyman-as-ceo-of-ai-unit.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">brought</a> on Mustafa Suleyman, who had co-founded AI research company DeepMind and sold it to Google in 2014. Suleyman, later co-founded and led startup Inflection AI, and was effectively acquihired by Microsoft.</p>

<p>In its annual report published in July, Microsoft named OpenAI as a competitor, adding the company to a roster that for years has included megacap peers Amazon, Apple, Google and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">Meta</a>. And in October, OpenAI <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/openai-launches-chatgpt-search-competing-with-google-and-perplexity.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">debuted a search feature within ChatGPT</a> that positions it to better compete with search engines like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a>&#8216;s Bing.</p>

<p>But the thorniest issue heading into the new year likely involves Musk, who has been a fixture at President-elect <strong>Donald Trump&#8217;s</strong> Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida since the election.</p>

<p>Trump has said in the past that he would repeal President <strong>Joe Biden&#8217;s</strong> AI executive order, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/30/biden-unveils-us-governments-first-ever-ai-executive-order.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">issued</a> in October 2023, which introduced new safety assessments, equity and civil rights guidance and research on AI&#8217;s impact on the labor market.</p>

<p>Musk is set to to lead the Trump administration&#8217;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is expected to function as an advisory office, alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. His new role could give Musk, who also runs <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078311">Tesla</a> and SpaceX and owns social media company X, influence over federal agencies&#8217; budgets, staffing and regulations in ways that favor his companies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Starting to feel like The @DOGE has real potential,&#8221; Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1857667225852826080">posted</a> on X last month.</p>

<p>OpenAI did not provide a comment for the story, and Musk didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment.</p>

<ul> <li>Fintech firm Dave came back from the brink of collapse, turned profitable and has consistently topped Wall Street analyst expectations. </li> <li>It&#8217;s the top gainer for 2024 among U.S. financial stocks, with a 934% year-to-date surge through Thursday.</li> <li>Fintech firms like Dave and Robinhood are the most promising heading into next year, according to JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan.</li></ul>

<p>Jason Wilk, the CEO of digital banking service <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DAVE&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078771">Dave</a>, remembers the absolute low point in his brief career as head of a publicly-traded firm.</p>

<p>It was June 2023, and shares of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/21/fintech-banking-app-dave-wants-to-dispel-doubts-after-97percent-stock-plunge.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078771">his company</a> had recently dipped below $5 apiece. Desperate to keep Dave afloat, Wilk found himself at a Los Angeles <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230502005308/en/LD-Micro-Announces-Invitational-XIII-and-Inaugural-Open-Forum">conference</a> for micro-cap stocks, where he pitched investors on tiny $5,000 stakes in his firm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to lie, this was probably the hardest time of my life,&#8221; Wilk told CNBC. &#8220;To go from being a $5 billion company to $50 million in 12 months, it was so freaking hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in the months that followed, Dave turned profitable and consistently topped Wall Street analyst expectations for revenue and profit. Now, Wilk&#8217;s company is the top gainer for 2024 among U.S. financial stocks, with a 934% year-to-date surge through Thursday.</p>

<p>The fintech firm, which makes money by extending small loans to cash-strapped Americans, is emblematic of a larger shift that&#8217;s still in its early stages, according to JMP Securities analyst <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/10/15/citizens-jmps-devin-ryan-on-top-takeaways-from-bank-earnings.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078771">Devin Ryan</a>.</p>

<p>Investors had dumped high-flying fintech companies in 2022 as a wave of unprofitable firms like Dave <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/mark-cuban-backed-dave-begins-trading-on-nasdaq-after-completing-spac.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078771">went public via special purpose acquisition companies</a>. The environment turned suddenly, from rewarding growth at any cost to deep skepticism of how money-losing firms would navigate rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve battled inflation.</p>

<p>Now, with the Fed easing rates, investors have rushed back into financial firms of all sizes, including alternative asset managers like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KKR&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078771">KKR</a> and credit card companies like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXP&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078771">American Express</a>, the top performers among financial stocks this year with market caps of at least $100 billion and $200 billion, respectively.</p>

<p>Big investment banks including <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078771">Goldman Sachs</a>, the top gainer among the six largest U.S. banks, have also surged this year on hope for a rebound in Wall Street deals activity.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s fintech firms like Dave and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HOOD&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078771">Robinhood</a>, the commission-free trading app, that are the most promising heading into next year, Ryan said.</p>

<p>Robinhood, whose shares have surged 190% this year, is the top gainer among financial firms with a market cap of at least $10 billion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both Dave and Robinhood went from losing money to being incredibly profitable firms,&#8221; Ryan said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve gotten their house in order by growing their revenues at an accelerating rate while managing expenses at the same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Ryan views valuations for investment banks and alternative asset manages as approaching &#8220;stretched&#8221; levels, he said that &#8220;fintechs still have a long way to run; they are early in their journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Financials broadly had already begun benefitting from the Fed easing cycle when the election victory of Donald Trump last month intensified interest in the sector. Investors expect Trump will ease regulation and allow for more innovation with government appointments including ex-<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PYPL&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078771">PayPal</a> executive and Silicon Valley investor <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/05/trump-david-sacks-billionaire-ai-crypto.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078771">David Sacks as AI and crypto czar.</a></p>

<p>Those expectations have boosted the shares of entrenched players like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078771">JPMorgan Chase</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/C&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078771">Citigroup</a>, but have had a greater impact on potential disruptors like Dave that could see even more upside from a looser regulatory environment.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Gas &amp; groceries</h4>

<p>Dave has built a niche among Americans underserved by traditional banks by offering fee-free checking and savings accounts.</p>

<p>It makes money mostly by extending small loans of around $180 each to help users &#8220;pay for gas and groceries&#8221; until their next paycheck, according to Wilk; Dave makes roughly $9 per loan on average.</p>

<p>The company also offers a debit card, and interchange fees from transactions made by Dave customers will make up an increasing share of revenue, Wilk said.</p>

<p>While the fintech firm faces far less skepticism now than it did in mid-2023— of the seven analysts who track it, all rate the stock a &#8220;buy,&#8221; according to Factset — Wilk said the company still has more to prove.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our business is so much better now than we went public, but it&#8217;s still priced 60% below the IPO price,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hopefully we can claw our way back.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s the season of giving, and billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott just announced she&#8217;s handed out more than $2 billion to 199 different organizations this year.</p>

<p>That brings the total amount donated by Scott since 2019 to $19.2 billion, based on her past public announcements of her charitable giving. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/mackenzie-scott/">Forbes</a> still estimates a $31.6 billion net worth for Scott, who became one of the world&#8217;s wealthiest women following her <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/the-top-10-most-expensive-divorces.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078531">2019 divorce</a> from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Scott received a 4% stake in Amazon in the divorce settlement.</p>

<p>Much of this latest round of donations went to organizations focused on alleviating poverty, Scott wrote in a <a href="https://yieldgiving.com/essays/investing/">blog post</a> on Wednesday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Roughly 75% of them are non-profits that support the economic security and opportunity of people who are struggling,&#8221; she wrote, adding that the organizations offer services ranging from access to affordable housing, healthcare and financial counseling to child development and post-secondary education.</p>

<p>Other organizations that received gifts from Scott focus on areas like &#8220;human rights and natural resources conservation,&#8221; she wrote.</p>

<p>In 2019, not long after her divorce settlement, Scott signed <a href="https://givingpledge.org/about">The Giving Pledge</a> and committed to giving away the majority of her wealth in her lifetime. Since then, she&#8217;s routinely ranked on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeswealthteam/2024/02/15/americas-top-givers-2024-the-25-most-philanthropic-billionaires/">Forbes&#8217; list</a> of the most generous billionaires, giving away roughly one-third of her net worth, according to the publication&#8217;s most recent list, published in February.</p>

<p>One goal of her philanthropy is &#8220;to de-emphasize privileged voices&#8221; such as her own, &#8220;and cede focus to others,&#8221; she wrote in a <a href="https://mackenzie-scott.medium.com/seeding-by-ceding-ea6de642bf">2021 blog post</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;People struggling against inequities deserve center stage in stories about change they are creating,&#8221; she wrote at the time. &#8220;This is equally — perhaps especially — true when their work is funded by wealth.&#8221;</p>

<p>In that same vein, Scott has tasked her investment advisors with identifying &#8220;funds and companies focused on for-profit solutions to these challenges&#8221; she tries to address through her philanthropy, Scott wrote on Wednesday.</p>

<p>In doing so, Scott would be following in the footsteps of other notable billionaire philanthropists who have embraced what&#8217;s known as &#8220;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/heres-what-y-impact-investing-where-returns-are-not-the-only-reward.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078531">impact investing</a>.&#8221; That includes the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation&#8217;s <a href="https://sif.gatesfoundation.org/">Strategic Investment Fund</a>, which focuses on the global health space, and Walmart heir <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/19/billionaire-lukas-waltons-family-office-fans-impact-investing-push.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078531">Lukas Walton</a>, whose Builders Vision investing and philanthropy platform shifted 90% of its billion-dollar endowment into impact investments in 2022.</p>

<p>For Scott, the goal is make a difference by investing with funds and companies offering solutions to societal issues before she takes her returns and donates them to non-profit organizations. </p>

<p>&#8220;When I make gifts, rather than withdrawing funds from a bank account, or from a stock portfolio that increases the wealth and influence of leaders who already have it, I&#8217;d like to withdraw them from a portfolio of investments in mission-aligned ventures, with leaders from the populations they are serving, or from generally undercapitalized groups like women and people of color,&#8221; Scott wrote.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>What a crazy, crazy year it&#8217;s been. I wrote fifty-four newsletters about it. And I was curious to check (because I&#8217;m too scared to check in real-time) which ones were the most-opened. Kind of like doing a Spotify &#8220;Wrapped&#8221;?  </p>

<p>What I found was that the open rate has actually been moving higher throughout the year&#8211;and really took off post-election. Pieces about the deficit, the rising stock market, and tariffs were all high on the list. But the number-one, most-opened piece of the year <em>by far </em>was about&#8230;you guessed it&#8230;<strong>inflation</strong>. (It was the only one with an estimated open rate above 75%.)  </p>

<p>Here are the top seven, which also got some of the most engagement and feedback. They&#8217;re basically all from November. Thank you so much for all of your replies and interactions. I can&#8217;t wait to see what next year brings. </p>

<p>1) <a href="https://link.cnbc.com/click/37928981.21095/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyNC8xMS8xMy9rZWxseS1ldmFucy1zdGlja3ktaW5mbGF0aW9uLmh0bWw_X19zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciU3Q3RoZWV4Y2hhbmdlIzp-OnRleHQ9SW4lMjBmYWN0JTJDJTIwY29yZSUyMGluZmxhdGlvbiUyMGhhcyxhcmVhcyUyMGlzJTIwYWxzbyUyMHN0aWxsJTIwcGVyc2lzdGVudC4/5b69019a24c17c709e62b008B9238c094">Sticky inflation</a> (&#8220;Are we about to kiss rate cuts goodbye?&#8221;)</p>

<p>One more that just missed the cutoff, but that I keep thinking about and will revisit next year, is &#8220;<a href="https://link.cnbc.com/click/37928981.21095/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyNC8xMi8wMi9rZWxseS1ldmFucy10aGVyZS1hcmUtYmlnLWRvd25zaWRlcy10by1raW5nLWRvbGxhci5odG1sP19fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXIlN0N0aGVleGNoYW5nZSM6fjp0ZXh0PVdlJTIwb3ZlciUyRGNvbnN1bWUlMjB0aGVpciUyMGdvb2RzLHRvJTIwa2VlcCUyMHRoZSUyMGVjb25vbXklMjBnb2luZy4/5b69019a24c17c709e62b008B3ff3b61a">There are big downsides to &#8216;King Dollar&#8217;</a>.&#8221; It&#8217;s very much connected to the tariffs piece listed above.  </p>

<p>And my personal favorite, which did pretty well and remains a running &#8220;sign of the top&#8221; joke at home: <a href="https://link.cnbc.com/click/37928981.21095/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vMjAyNC8xMS8yMC9rZWxseS1ldmFucy1ob3ctaS1sZWFybmVkLXRvLXN0b3Atd29ycnlpbmctYW5kLWxvdmUtdGhlLXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC5odG1sP19fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXIlN0N0aGVleGNoYW5nZQ/5b69019a24c17c709e62b008Bc7cc040c">How I learned to stop worrying and love the stock market</a>.  </p>

<p>So that&#8217;s a &#8220;wrap&#8221; on a very insane, very fun year.  </p>

<p>See you at 1 p.m&#8230;and don&#8217;t miss an extra-special (and very bittersweet) ending to Power Lunch at 2:55 ET today. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<ul> <li>Lawmakers in the House voted down a short-term spending bill on Thursday, raising the chances for a government shutdown.</li> <li>If no deal is reached, the shutdown could begin 12:01 a.m. ET on Saturday.</li> <li>Air traffic controllers and TSA agents are considered essential employees, though they could end up working without a paycheck.</li></ul>

<p>A <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/live-blog/government-shutdown-live-updates-rcna184880">government shutdown</a> is looming just as the peak holiday travel season gets underway.</p>

<p>Lawmakers have been at an impasse and on Thursday <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-republicans-say-they-have-deal-to-avert-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078757">voted down</a> a short-term bill, which was backed by President-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, to continue to fund the U.S. government. A shutdown could begin as early as 12:01 a.m. ET on Saturday if no deal is reached.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of government employees would be furloughed if Congress fails to pass a spending bill.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What does this mean for air travel?</h4>

<p>Commercial airplanes are still scheduled to fly, even given the chance of a shutdown.</p>

<p>Airlines are forecasting the busiest year-end holiday season on record. The Transportation Security Administration expects its officers to screen more than 40 million people during the holidays through Jan. 2. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UAL&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078757">United Airlines</a> alone said it will fly 9.9 million people between Dec. 19 and Jan. 6, up 12% over last year.</p>

<p>The government deems the more than 14,000 air traffic controllers and close to 60,000 TSA agents essential, which means they would continue working, though they wouldn&#8217;t be paid during the shutdown.</p>

<div style="border-top: 3px solid;border-bottom: 1px solid;padding: 15px 20px 0 20px" class="CNBC-related-content-module"> <ul><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/10/alaska-airlines-nonstop-flights-japan-korea.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078757">Alaska Airlines plans new nonstop flights to Asia, Europe in $1 billion postmerger profit push</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/20/american-airlines-boarding-line-shaming-technology.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078757">American Airlines cracks down on boarding line cutters with new technology</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/18/spirit-airlines-files-bankruptcy-protection.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078757">Budget travel icon Spirit Airlines files for bankruptcy protection</a></li></ul></div>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Prepare for longer lines?</h4>

<p>TSA officers &#8220;would continue working without pay in the event of a shutdown,&#8221; the agency&#8217;s administrator, David Pekoske, said Thursday on <a href="https://x.com/TSA_Pekoske/status/1869826938376015926">social media platform X</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure the security of our transportation systems, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,&#8221; the TSA said in a statement Friday.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What happened last time?</h4>

<p>The last time the government shut down, it stretched for more than a month from late 2018 through early 2019.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/faa-halts-traffic-into-laguardia-airport-amid-shortage-of-tsa-workers.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078757">Callouts</a> from a few air traffic controllers in the highly congested airspace along the U.S. East Coast snarled air traffic during that shutdown. Then-President Trump and lawmakers reached a deal shortly after that to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/faa-halts-traffic-into-laguardia-airport-amid-shortage-of-tsa-workers.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078757">end</a> the shutdown, the longest funding lapse in U.S. history.</p>

<p>Congestion has vexed airline leaders. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration is once again without a permanent administrator after FAA chief Mike Whitaker, who was appointed by President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> last year, said he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/12/federal-aviation-administration-head-michael-whitaker-to-step-down-jan-20.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078757">will step down</a> Jan. 20, when Trump takes office.</p>

<p>Modernization of air traffic control and hiring more controllers should be the next FAA administrator&#8217;s priority, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DAL&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078757">Delta Air Lines</a> CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC earlier this week.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>For 86 years, researchers at Harvard have been studying the lives of hundreds of people and their families to discover <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/10/85-year-harvard-study-found-the-secret-to-a-long-happy-and-successful-life.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108076346">what makes us happy</a>.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/21/7-practices-that-lead-to-happiness-and-good-health-from-harvard-study.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108076346">Harvard Study of Adult Development found</a> that happy people tend to have good conflict-resolution skills, exercise often and maintain positive relationships.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/robert-waldinger/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108076346">Dr. Robert Waldinger</a>, the study&#8217;s director and a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, recently appeared on Simon Sinek&#8217;s <a href="https://simonsinek.com/podcast/episodes/the-secret-to-happiness-with-harvard-professor-robert-waldinger/?utm_source=LinkedIn&amp;utm_medium=Personal&amp;utm_campaign=ABoO_Robert-Waldinger">&#8220;A Bit of Optimism&#8221; podcast</a>.</p>

<p>When asked what the happiest people &#8220;get right&#8221; as teens and young adults, Waldinger said they &#8220;care about making a difference in the world, and they care about the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even if their purpose changes, &#8220;the people who stay with that aspiration, I think stay engaged in life. And I think that&#8217;s what they get right,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>This aligns with what longevity researchers and happiness experts say about the importance of having a purpose for life satisfaction and wellbeing. Waldinger points to psychoanalyst Erik Erikson&#8217;s concept of <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/generativity-vs-stagnation-7550473#:~:text=Generativity%20refers%20to%20making%20a,lacking%20a%20sense%20of%20purpose.">generativity versus stagnation</a> in adult development.</p>

<p>&#8220;Generativity [is] wanting to be part of something bigger than yourself,&#8221; Waldinger explained. &#8220;Realizing, &#8216;Oh I want to help raise kids&#8217; or &#8216;I want to mentor people&#8217; or &#8216;I want to do something that&#8217;s not just [about] me.'&#8221;</p>

<p>Stagnation is the opposite and involves feeling stuck in life and struggling to find a sense of meaning.</p>

<p>The people who choose generativity over stagnation, especially throughout the different stages of their lives, &#8220;become the people who are going to look back on their lives with less regret, with more of a sense that my life was good enough,&#8221; Waldinger said.</p>

<ul> <li>Netflix on Friday announced it has secured exclusive broadcast rights in the U.S. to the FIFA Women&#8217;s World Cup in 2027 and 2031.</li> <li>The streaming giant said coverage will include commentary and entertainment from studio shows and top-tier talent, as well as Netflix original documentaries in the lead-up to the tournament.</li> <li>The 2027 tournament is set to take place in 12 cities across Brazil. </li> <li>The host country for the 2031 tournament is yet to be announced.</li></ul>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NFLX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078778">Netflix</a> on Friday <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/womens-world-cup-netflix">announced</a> it has secured exclusive rights in the U.S. to the FIFA Women&#8217;s World Cup in 2027 and 2031.</p>

<p>The announcement comes just days before Netflix will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/15/netflix-to-stream-holiday-nfl-games-for-three-years.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078778">stream</a> its first ever National Football League Christmas Day games. Adding the Women&#8217;s World Cup to its portfolio shows the streaming giant is continuing to bulk up its sports rights portfolio. It also comes as the popularity of women&#8217;s sports has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/08/womens-sports-could-bring-in-over-1-billion-in-2024-whats-driving-growth.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078778">risen</a> over the past year.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the fandom for the FIFA Women&#8217;s World Cup grow tremendously — from the electric atmosphere in France in 2019, and most recently, the incredible energy across Australia and New Zealand in 2023,&#8221; Netflix Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria said in a press release. &#8220;Bringing this iconic tournament to Netflix is not just about streaming matches — it&#8217;s about celebrating the players, the culture, and the passion driving the global rise of women&#8217;s sports.&#8221;</p>

<p>The 2027 tournament is set to take place in 12 cities across Brazil. The host country for the 2031 tournament is yet to be announced.</p>

<p>Netflix said coverage of the Women&#8217;s World Cup will include commentary and entertainment from studio shows and top-tier talent, as well as Netflix original documentaries around major players and the sport&#8217;s rapidly growing fan base in the lead-up to the tournament.</p>

<p>The Women&#8217;s World Cup has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/16/attendance-and-ticket-records-keep-growing-at-2023-womens-world-cup.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078778">continued to grow in popularity</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/10/us-viewership-of-the-womens-world-cup-final-was-higher-than-the-mens.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078778">more people in the U.S.</a> tuned in for the women&#8217;s final in 2019 than the men&#8217;s in 2018. U.S. viewership <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2023/08/22/the-us-audience-for-the-fifa-womens-world-cup-final-drops-to-22-million/">dropped substantially</a> in 2023, however, after the two-time defending champions were knocked out in the Round of 16.</p>

<p>As the audience for the WNBA and women&#8217;s national soccer team has grown significantly in the U.S., soccer remains one of the most popular sports globally.</p>

<p>Netflix has 282.7 million global memberships, and the streamer has been pushing for growth internationally in part through its cheaper, ad-supported tier.</p>

<p>Sports media rights have also exploded in valuation for media companies as live sports beckon the biggest audiences.</p>

<p>Netflix has continued to grow into the sports category, streaming a Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight last month, which was watched by 108 million people, making it the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-was-most-streamed-sports-event-netflix-says.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078778">most-streamed sporting event ever</a>, according to Netflix.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, the streamer is set to cover the NFL double-header featuring the Kansas City Chiefs versus the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens versus the Houston Texans.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>From Black Friday to the end of the year, it can feel like there&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/14/7-splurges-cnbc-make-it-staff-thought-were-worth-the-money.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078530">constant pull to spend, spend, spend</a> on an endless number of parties, gifts and events. Without careful oversight, it can be easy to go overboard.</p>

<p>As a money editor and certified financial planner professional, spending too much is something I think and talk about a lot. I&#8217;ve previously overdone it on the holidays myself, and tapped out is not a fun way to start a new year.</p>

<p>Luckily, I&#8217;ve also learned a number of strategies to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/how-to-follow-the-50-30-20-budgeting-strategy.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078530">make it easier to budget</a> during a spendy period.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I tell my friends when they ask how to avoid overspending around the holidays.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4 money strategies you can use right away</h4>

<p>We&#8217;re in the thick of the holiday season, and you may be looking for strategies you can put to use immediately. Here are four things you can do right now to maximize your budget without overspending. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Set a hard boundary</strong></h3>

<p>Take a look at your budget to determine the absolute most you can comfortably spend on gifts and events this season. Then <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/if-you-use-these-3-phrases-you-have-healthy-workplace-boundaries.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078530">be vocal</a> about it.</p>

<p>Let your friends and family know when you can&#8217;t afford something. It&#8217;s OK to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m choosing to focus on X, Y and Z this year, so I won&#8217;t be able to attend that event.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Prioritize</strong></h3>

<p>Now that you know how much you have to spend, list out all of the possible ways you could use that cash. What are your top priorities? Consider everything between today and New Year&#8217;s, from your work gift exchange to brunch on Jan. 1.</p>

<p>Knowing you want to save up for something at the end of the season can help you determine what you&#8217;re able to say yes to now. You can even prioritize within a plan. Yes, you&#8217;ll buy tickets to see the Nutcracker, but no, you can&#8217;t make it for dinner out beforehand, for instance.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Use cash</strong></h3>

<p>Take out the amount you determined above in cash and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/27/after-a-month-on-a-cash-diet-here-are-my-best-money-saving-tips.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078530">stick to that for the next month</a>.</p>

<p>For many people, seeing their money physically dwindle is a tactile reminder of the budget they want to stick to. When you&#8217;re out of cash, you&#8217;re done spending.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Unsubscribe</strong></h3>

<p>If holiday discounts and after-Christmas sales are your weakness, try unsubscribing from retailers&#8217; email lists or filtering them directly into spam. Avoiding the sale altogether may help you avoid temptation. </p>

<iframe src="https://player.cnbc.com/p/gZWlPC/cnbc_global?playertype=synd&amp;autoplay=true&amp;byGuid=7000291601" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen class="cnbcplayer"></iframe>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3 ways to start fresh in 2025</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s never too early to start planning, especially if you know there are certain times of year you&#8217;re likely to overspend, such as on a summer vacation or around the winter holidays. As the new year rolls in, here are three ways to make it easier on yourself going forward.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Start a sinking fund</strong></h3>

<p>This time of year can be expensive because everything piles up at once. One way to combat that is to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/10/how-a-sinking-fund-can-keep-you-from-blowing-your-budget.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078530">save up throughout the year</a> so you have a larger budget for the last few months.</p>

<p>Look back at how much you spent this year. Make sure to include everything — not just gifts, but Uber rides, holiday tips and any other related expenses. If that&#8217;s a comfortable amount, divide by 12 and set that amount aside every month.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s much less daunting to save $100 a month than to spend $1,200 all at once. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Buy gifts throughout the year</strong></h3>

<p>If gift giving is a non-negotiable for you, start <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/15/gift-recommendations-from-cnbc-make-it-staff-that-i-bought-for-myself.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078530">picking up gifts</a> whenever you see something someone on your list would like.</p>

<p>I always exchange Christmas and birthday presents with my best friend, so whenever I see a potential gift for her, I grab it. That helps me spread out the cost throughout the year. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Choose an alternative to gift giving</strong></h3>

<p>If gifts are eating into your budget, consider suggesting a few alternatives to your family and friends. There&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;re not the only one in search of a more affordable option.</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas to get you started:</p>

				<![CDATA[
<ul> <li>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Friday sued the operator of the Zelle payments network and the three U.S. banks that dominant transactions on it.</li> <li>The agency alleges that the firms failed to properly investigate fraud complaints or give victims reimbursements.</li> <li>Zelle said in a statement Friday that it was prepared to defend itself against this &#8220;meritless lawsuit.&#8221;</li></ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> on Friday <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-jpmorgan-chase-bank-of-america-and-wells-fargo-for-allowing-fraud-to-fester-on-zelle/">sued</a> the operator of the Zelle payments network and the three U.S. banks that dominate transactions on it, alleging that the firms failed to properly investigate fraud complaints or give victims reimbursement.</p>

<p>The CFPB <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_Zelle-Complaint_2024-12.pdf">said</a> customers of the three banks — <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078781">JPMorgan Chase</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAC&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078781">Bank of America</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WFC&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078781">Wells Fargo</a> — have lost more than $870 million since the launch of Zelle in 2017.</p>

<p>Zelle, a peer-to-peer payments network run by bank-owned fintech firm Early Warning Services, allows for instant payments to other consumers and businesses and has quickly surged to become the biggest such service in the country. At the same time, Democrat lawmakers have stepped up criticism of banks in recent years over the financial crimes happening on Zelle.</p>

<p>&#8220;The nation&#8217;s largest banks felt threatened by competing payment apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle,&#8221; CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. &#8220;By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fend for themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>The suit is the latest move by the CFPB in the waning days of the Biden administration. Many of the actions it has taken, including steps to limit credit card <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/credit-card-late-fees-new-cap/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078781">late fees</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/12/cfpb-bank-overdraft-fees-rule.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078781">overdraft charges</a>, have been met with stiff opposition from banks and their trade groups. Corporations have had success pushing back against regulators by choosing legal venues <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/27/jpmorgan-chase-prepared-to-sue-us-government.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078781">known as friendly</a> to suits challenging federal oversight.</p>

<p>In fact, JPMorgan <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/27/jpmorgan-chase-prepared-to-sue-us-government.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078781">said</a> in August that it was considering litigation against the CFPB if the regulator sought to punish the bank for its role in the Zelle network.</p>

<p>The CFPB wants to force banks to stop their allegedly unlawful practices around Zelle and to pay an unspecified amount in penalties, it said.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;Glaring flaws&#8217;</h4>

<p>The vast majority of Zelle activity is uneventful; of the $806 billion that flowed across the network last year, only $166 million in transactions was disputed as fraud by customers of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, the three biggest players on the platform.</p>

<p>But the three banks collectively reimbursed just 38% of those claims, according to a July Senate <a href="https://aboutblaw.com/beXw">report</a> that looked at disputed unauthorized transactions.</p>

<p>Banks say that they investigate each fraud claim, but that they often find that what customers say was fraud was technically a scam where customers authorized payments. In those cases, banks aren&#8217;t usually required to make customers whole.</p>

<p>The CFPB claimed that Zelle&#8217;s &#8220;limited identity verification methods&#8221; have allowed criminals to infiltrate the network, enabling them to divert payments and move between member banks that didn&#8217;t share information among institutions.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/108078798-1734706888540-gettyimages-1838655467-raa-onlineba231210_npKnX.jpeg?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="The Zelle online banking logo is being displayed on a smartphone with the Zelle web page visible in the background, in this photo illustration, in Brussels, Belgium, on December 10, 2023. " data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite>Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty Images</cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-text="The Zelle online banking logo is being displayed on a smartphone with the Zelle web page visible in the background, in this photo illustration, in Brussels, Belgium, on December 10, 2023. " data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text">The Zelle online banking logo is being displayed on a smartphone with the Zelle web page visible in the background, in this photo illustration, in Brussels, Belgium, on December 10, 2023. </span></span></div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The agency also said that banks failed to properly investigate complaints about Zelle activity and didn&#8217;t consistently report fraud activity.</p>

<p>&#8220;The banks failed to fix glaring flaws in their systems even as hundreds of thousands of customers filed complaints about fraud,&#8221; Chopra told reporters during a call on Friday. &#8220;The banks knew their customers were having their money stolen, but since they weren&#8217;t bearing the cost of these losses themselves, they dragged their feet on fixing the problems.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zelle is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/zelle-digital-scams-banks.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078781">preferred way</a> for cyber criminals to extract funds because it is faster than other remittance options, according to Tom Peacock, Director of Global Fraud Intelligence for cybersecurity firm BioCatch.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;Meritless&#8217; and misleading</h4>

<p> Early Warning Services said in a statement Friday that it was prepared to defend itself against this &#8220;meritless lawsuit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zelle leads the fight against scams and fraud and has industry-leading reimbursement policies that go above and beyond the law,&#8221; said Jane Khodos, an Early Warning Services spokeswoman. &#8220;The CFPB&#8217;s misguided attacks will embolden criminals, cost consumers more in fees, stifle small businesses and make it harder for thousands of community banks and credit unions to compete.&#8221;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the $870 million figure cited by the CFPB for fraud losses is misleading because it includes incidents where the bank found that cases didn&#8217;t involve fraud, but errors or false claims, according to Early Warning Services.</p>

<p>Early Warning Services has said that while transaction volumes rose in 2023, reports of scams and fraud fell by <a href="https://www.zellepay.com/press-releases/more-people-ever-choose-zelle-nearly-half-trillion-dollars-sent-first-half-2024#:~:text=As%20of%20June%202024%2C%20143,the%20first%20half%20of%202024">almost 50</a>%, and that only a tiny fraction of payment volumes are disputed as fraud.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Being told you aren&#8217;t ready or qualified for a role because of your age, having your qualifications questioned, and being mistaken for someone junior are all examples of ageism, or discrimination based on one&#8217;s age.</p>

<p>Typically associated with older workers, the reality may be that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/19/millennial-and-gen-z-women-feel-ageism-most-report-finds.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077243">young women bear the brunt of age-related biases</a> in the workplace, according to <a href="https://womenintheworkplace.com/">research</a> from McKinsey &amp; Co. and Lean In, a non-profit working to empower women <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/sheryl-sandberg-on-new-women-in-the-workplace-report.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077243">co-founded by former Meta chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.</a></p>

<p>&#8220;We tend to promote young men based on potential, and young women based on what they&#8217;ve actually accomplished,&#8221; says Rachel Thomas, the co-founder and CEO of Lean In.</p>

<p>The goal for workplaces, Thomas says, should be to create a supportive environment where young women can thrive. Unfortunately, ageism can be an inescapable obstacle for so many of them.</p>

<p>If you feel like you are being discounted for your age, Thomas recommends adopting these three habits:</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ask probing questions</h4>

<p>If someone suggests you aren&#8217;t ready for a promotion or to lead a major project, Thomas says consider asking, &#8220;What makes you say that?&#8221; with the &#8220;biggest, sweetest, sweetest smile&#8221; on your face.</p>

<p>A simple probing question like this one, Thomas says, can force fact-based thinking and help reveal someone&#8217;s biases, allowing you to gain clarity, while subtly challenging their underlying assumptions.</p>

<p>Because there is always the chance of pushback, Thomas says, the words you choose, and how you deliver them, are important — particularly for young women who are being assertive or challenging the status quo.</p>

<p>For more pointed questions, frame it from a point of curiosity: Start the question with &#8220;I really want to understand so I can do better,&#8221; or &#8220;Your opinion really matters to me so I&#8217;d like to go deeper and understand,&#8221; she adds.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Build a case for your accomplishments</h4>

<p>Keep a running list of your accomplishments, skills and contributions regardless of their size, Thomas says.</p>

<p>This is useful not only as a reminder for yourself, but for others when the time is right, like a performance review or when you want to take on more responsibility. The data will counter any assumptions based on age or gender that may arise.</p>

<p>Proactively sharing these accomplishments can keep your work visible.</p>

<p>Thomas, a manager herself, says she finds emails with quick reminders about recent successes particularly useful. &#8220;As a manager, you do get busy and have a lot on your plate, so that reminder can be really effective.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Find and foster authentic mentorship</h4>

<p>Developing strong relationships with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/24/tom-corley-mentors-fast-track-success.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077243">mentors and sponsors</a>, especially in senior leadership positions, is crucial for career advancement, as they can provide guidance, advocacy and access to new opportunities.</p>

<p>Most people in senior positions, however, tend to be men, which can complicate the process for young women, as people often gravitate toward individuals who remind them of themselves.</p>

<p>Rather than directly asking someone to be your sponsor, Thomas recommends building a more natural rapport and demonstrating your value over time. &#8220;The people that choose to be your sponsor and that you build deeper relationships with are more likely to actually open doors for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Effective mentorship and sponsorship is a &#8220;two-way street,&#8221; where follow-up is key, Thomas says.</p>

<p>A great way to do this is to share updates with your mentor about how their guidance has made a difference in your career. Showing them that their investment in you has made a tangible impact will motivate them to continue to offer their support.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<ul> <li>In 2023, the average 401(k) savings rate, including employee deferrals and company contributions, was 12.7%, up from 12.1% in 2022, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America.</li> <li>While Vanguard recommends a combined savings rate of 12% to 15%, Fidelity Investments says investors should aim for 15%.</li> <li>If you can&#8217;t reach those percentages, you should defer at least enough to get your employer&#8217;s full matching contribution, experts say.</li></ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/24/average-401k-savings-rate.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078267">average 401(k) savings</a> rate, including employee deferrals and company contributions, continued to climb in 2023, a new industry survey reported.</p>

<p>In 2023, the average combined savings rate was 12.7%, up from 12.1% in 2022,<strong> </strong>with employees deferring 7.8% of pay and companies adding 4.9%, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America&#8217;s <a href="https://www.psca.org/industry-content/surveys/annual-401k-survey/">yearly survey</a> of more than 700 company 401(k) and profit-sharing plans.  </p>

<p>&#8220;The deferral rate has been trending up over time,&#8221; with dips during economic downturns, said Hattie Greenan, director of research and communications for the Plan Sponsor Council of America.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Vanguard reported the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/24/average-401k-savings-rate.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078267">average combined savings rate</a> was an <a href="https://institutional.vanguard.com/insights-and-research/report/how-america-saves.html">estimated 11.7%</a> in 2023, which matched the figures from 2022, according to the company&#8217;s yearly analysis of more than 1,500 qualified plans and nearly 5 million participants.</p>

<p>Fidelity Investments, which reports retirement savings rates quarterly, estimated the <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/about-fidelity/Q3-2024-retirement-analysis">combined savings rate</a> was 14.1%, as of Sept. 30, 2024, based on an analysis of 26,000 corporate retirement plans.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How much to save in your 401(k)</h4>

<p>Vanguard recommends <a href="https://ownyourfuture.vanguard.com/content/en/learn/financial-planning/how-much-should-i-be-saving.html">saving 12% to 15%</a> of your earnings every year, including employer contributions, to meet your retirement needs. The combined savings benchmark for Fidelity is 15%.  </p>

<p>Typically, companies <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/20/401k-match-retirement-savings.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078267">match employee deferrals</a> up to a specified limit — and you should aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, said Greenan from the Plan Sponsor Council of America.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s really going to add up over time,&#8221; she said. </p>

<p>More than 80% of plans included a matching contribution in 2023, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America report.</p>

<p>After hitting the match, some experts suggest boosting your deferrals every year, but &#8220;you&#8217;re going to see growth from whatever you can afford to contribute,&#8221; Greenan said.</p>

<p>Starting in 2025, the 401(k) maximum employee deferral will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/401k-contribution-limits-2025.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078267">jump to $23,500</a>, up from $23,000 in 2024. The 401(k) catch-up contribution will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/401k-catch-up-contributions-2025.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078267">remain $7,500</a> for workers 50 and older, but <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/23/401k-changes-2025.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078267">increases to $11,250</a> for investors aged 60 to 63. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re planning to save more in 2025, right now is &#8220;an important time of the year&#8221; to boost deferrals, said certified financial planner and enrolled agent Catherine Valega, founder of Boston-area Green Bee Advisory. </p>

<p>Typically, it takes a few paychecks until your 401(k) deferral updates go into effect, so it&#8217;s better to make changes in December to be ready for January, she said. </p>

<p>Only 14% of employees <a href="https://institutional.vanguard.com/content/dam/inst/iig-transformation/insights/pdf/2024/has/how_america_saves_report_2024.pdf">maxed out 401(k) plans</a> in 2023, according to Vanguard&#8217;s annual report. On top of maxed-out contributions, an estimated 15% of workers made catch-up contributions in plans with the feature, the same report found.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>As a kid growing up in &#8220;the boondocks&#8221; of North Carolina, Jon Collins-Black was fond of digging in the dirt to look for rocks and arrowheads. </p>

<p>With an active <a href="https://www.emeraldhollowmine.com/">emerald mine</a> not too far from where he lived, Collins-Black was drawn to the idea of finding something of value hidden away, just out of sight. </p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always had a spirit of adventure,&#8221; Collins-Black tells CNBC Make It. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been looking for stuff.&#8221; </p>

<p>So it should come as no surprise that Collins-Black is the man behind the the world&#8217;s latest <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/05/crypto-millionaire-has-hidden-multiple-100000-bitcoin-around-the-us.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077880">treasure hunt</a>, having hidden chests full of millions of dollars worth of gold, crypto and rare valuables across the United States. </p>

<p>He first struck gold – metaphorically speaking – back in 2013 when he invested $50,000 in Bitcoin at the price of $125. A little over a decade later, a single bitcoin is now worth more than $100,000. That windfall gave him the financial freedom to spend his time how we wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kind of had this niggling idea of, &#8216;What&#8217;s stopping me from doing my own treasure hunt?'&#8221; he says. &#8220;And it was like, &#8216;Nothing. In fact, I have the financial means to do it. I can do it however I want to.'&#8221; </p>

<p>Having once been a treasure-hunter himself — trying in vain to find the <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/exploration-survival/forrest-fenn-treasure-jack-stuef/">gold hidden by Forrest Fenn</a> in 2010 — Collins-Black set out to assemble five chests and hide them across the country. </p>

<p>&#8220;I grossly underestimated the time it would take me,&#8221; he says. &#8220;At the time I was like &#8216;Oh, I could probably pull this off in 18 months.&#8217; And now it&#8217;s almost five years later.&#8221; </p>

<p>Collins-Black spent roughly two million dollars obtaining the valuables, which include multiple bitcoin, plenty of gold, a rare, holographic Pokémon card and a glass once owned by George Washington. </p>

<p>He wanted to put together prizes that would inspire treasure hunters to go all-out to find them, but not valuable enough that anyone would put their safety at risk. Five people <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/forrest-fenn-treasure-five-deaths-48-hours/">lost their lives</a> while searching for Forrest Fenn&#8217;s treasure before it was eventually found.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a question in my mind about how much I should spend on the treasure, because I didn&#8217;t want to make it too crazy,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;I knew from the Forrest Fenn experience that people can get a little excited, sometimes too excited, and they can make bad decisions as a consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would go on to hike hundreds of miles across the country finding the perfect hiding spots for his treasures. Collins-Black details the contents of the five chests— and the clues hunters will need to find them — in his new book, &#8220;<a href="https://treasureinside.com/">There&#8217;s Treasure Inside</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Collins-Black doesn&#8217;t know how long it will take treasure seekers to find what he&#8217;s hidden, but he &#8220;deliberately picked items that I think are going to go up in value&#8221; over time as people keep looking. </p>

<p>&#8220;My thinking was: If it takes five years to find these treasures, it&#8217;s going to be worth more then,&#8221; he says. &#8220;So maybe some people stopped looking because they gave up, but other people are going to be even more motivated because they&#8217;re looking for a $3 million or $4 million or $5 million treasure.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Self-made billionaire <strong>Mark Cuban</strong> says college is worth a shot for everyone, even if you don&#8217;t end up getting a degree — and where you do doesn&#8217;t really matter. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re worried about racking up student loan debt, unsure whether college will benefit you long-term or considering delaying your decision with a gap year, Cuban has a simple piece of advice: &#8220;Go to a cheap school,&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEK2063FPLw">Cuban said </a>in a Monday interview with social media personality Jules Terpak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to school isn&#8217;t about your major — at least not in the first two years,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s about learning how to learn and it&#8217;s about getting excited to learn and exposing yourself to all kinds of different people [and] ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cuban understands that college can be &#8220;so expensive,&#8221; he says. So, if uncertainty over your future plans makes college tuition seem like an unnecessary expense, Cuban says opting for a &#8220;cheap&#8221; school could be your best route.</p>

<p><em><strong>DON&#8217;T MISS: </strong></em><a href="https://cnb.cx/3waBx4l"><em><strong>The ultimate guide to earning passive income online</strong></em></a></p>

<p>For some, that could mean opting for a public university with lower tuition for in-state students or attending a school that offers you a generous financial aid package. Cuban advocates for two-year community colleges, where the average tuition is <a href="https://research.collegeboard.org/trends/college-pricing/highlights">just over $4,000</a> annually, according to the College Board.</p>

<p>Cuban himself was an in-state student at the University of Pittsburgh for a year, before transferring to Indiana University and graduating from there in 1981. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/20/mark-cuban-graduated-high-school-early-and-started-college-at-17.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077204">He picked Indiana because it had the cheapest tuition</a> out of the country&#8217;s top 10 business education programs, at the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not one of these people that says: &#8216;Don&#8217;t go to college. Go start a company,'&#8221; Cuban said. &#8220;If you want to start a business, go to college and learn the language of business.&#8221;</p>

<p>You can learn important skills by taking classes in areas like accounting, finance, and marketing, Cuban added: &#8220;Those are tools that are really going to be helpful for business, even if you don&#8217;t end up getting a degree. That&#8217;s fine.&#8221; </p>

<p>After a brief post-graduation <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/24/mark-cuban-says-this-is-why-he-was-a-lousy-employee.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077204">stint in banking</a>, Cuban started a software startup called MicroSolutions that he sold to CompuServe for $6 million in 1990. His next tech company, audio streaming platform Broadcast.com, sold to Yahoo for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/15/mark-cuban-on-broadcastcom-streaming-people-thought-i-was-an-idiot.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077204">$5.7 billion</a> in 1999, making him a billionaire. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">There&#8217;s no such thing as a &#8216;good college&#8217;: expert</h4>

<p>Workers with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/23/a-college-degree-is-still-worth-the-investment-studies-show.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077204">college degrees do earn more</a> on average than any other group, and those with at least &#8220;some college&#8221; education earn more than those without, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.</p>

<p>But the challenge of paying off large student loan debts has led many Americans to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/23/is-college-worth-the-cost.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077204">question the value of attending college</a> at all.</p>

<p>Cuban isn&#8217;t alone in believing that the value of college isn&#8217;t dependent on how prestigious, or expensive, a school is. Parenting researcher and author Jennifer Breheny Wallace tells her own kids that there&#8217;s no such thing as a &#8220;good college,&#8221; and they should focus on getting the most out of their education, no matter where they enroll, she <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/16/toxic-parenting-experts-advice-ignore-myth-of-college-rankings.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077204">told CNBC Make It</a> last year.</p>

<p>College graduates&#8217; future wellbeing primarily depends on their on-campus experiences, not the prestige of their schools, according to a 2014 <a href="https://www.gallup.com/services/176768/2014-gallup-purdue-index-report.aspx">survey</a> of 30,000 U.S. college graduates by Gallup and Purdue University.</p>

<p>&#8220;We all know people who went to these highly selective schools whose lives did not turn out as well as they had hoped,&#8221; said Wallace. &#8220;And we all have adults in our lives, who [went to] schools we&#8217;ve never even heard of before, whose lives turned out extraordinary.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>While younger workers are <a href="https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/generational_changes_in_401%28k%29_behaviors.pdf">increasingly enrolling in 401(k) plans</a>, many might not be saving enough.</p>

<p>Nearly half (44%) of workers ages 21 to 34 have saved more than $50,001 in their 401(k) accounts, according to <a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/401k/how-much-money-americans-have-in-their-401k-plans-at-every-age/">a recent survey</a> by personal finance website GOBankingRates, which polled 1,000 working Americans ages 21 and older who have been in their current roles for at least one year.</p>

<p>While $50,001 is a significant amount — exceeding the median personal income of <a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/401k/how-much-money-americans-have-in-their-401k-plans-at-every-age/">$42,220 per year</a> — it may still fall short of a common retirement readiness benchmark.</p>

<p>Financial firm Fidelity recommends saving at least <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/how-much-do-i-need-to-retire">the equivalent of your annual salary by age 30</a> and twice your salary by 35. That progresses to three times your salary by age 40, six times by 50, eight times by 60, and 10 times by 67.</p>

<p>For a worker earning the median income, this means having:</p>

<ul> <li><strong>$42,220</strong> saved by age 30</li> <li><strong>$84,440</strong> saved by age 35</li> <li><strong>$126,660</strong> saved by age 40</li></ul>

<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of how much workers 21 to 35 have in their 401(k)s, according to GOBankingRates&#8217; survey:</p>

<ul> <li><strong>Less than $25,000:</strong> 19.6%</li> <li><strong>$25,001 — $50,000:</strong> 31.7%</li> <li><strong>$50,001 — $100,000:</strong> 32.9%</li> <li><strong>$100,001 — $500,000:</strong> 10.8%</li> <li><strong>$500,001 — $1 million:</strong> 0%</li> <li><strong>More than $1 million:</strong> 0%</li> <li><strong>I don&#8217;t have a 401(k):</strong> 5.1%</li></ul>

<p>While these numbers show that many younger Americans may not yet be fully prepared for retirement, it&#8217;s important to remember they only represent 401(k) balances. Other savings, like individual retirement accounts, brokerage accounts, cash reserves or potential inheritances, could help boost retirement wealth down the road.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that workers often increase their retirement contributions later in life to make up for lower earnings earlier in their careers, so playing catch-up is common.</p>

<p>As workers get older, their 401(k) balances tend to grow. This may be reflected in the share of workers with more than $100,000 in their accounts, which doubles from about 11% under 35 to nearly 21% by their mid-40s, GOBankingRates&#8217; study finds.</p>

<p>However, while catching up in your 30s and 40s is possible, delaying contributions <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/01/how-much-to-save-monthly-to-retire-with-one-million-dollars.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108076661">can require significantly higher monthly savings later in life</a> to reach the same retirement balance.</p>

<p>This is because starting later means missing out on the power of compound interest, which allows investments to grow exponentially over time.</p>

<p>If you invest $200 per month starting at age 25, it will grow to around $525,000 by age 65, assuming a 7% annual return. Waiting until age 35 to start would require contributing around $430 per month to achieve the same result.</p>

<p>This is why financial planners strongly recommend <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/14/gen-z-retirement-saving-younger-millennials-ira-investing.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108076661">starting as early as possible</a>, even with small contributions like $50 per month.</p>

<ul>
<li>Starbucks baristas are striking in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle.</li>



<li>Starbucks Workers United is pushing for better pay for baristas as it negotiates with the company.</li>



<li>The coffee giant said in a statement that the union prematurely ended its bargaining session this week.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SBUX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078709">Starbucks</a> baristas in some locations are planning to strike through Christmas Eve, starting with cafes in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle on Friday.</p>



<p>The strikes will escalate each day, covering new markets, as Starbucks Workers United pushes for better pay for baristas. Starbucks is &#8220;backtracking on our promised path forward,&#8221; the union <a href="https://x.com/SBWorkersUnited/status/1869924765605011761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a post</a> on X announcing the strikes.</p>



<p>The stoppage could mean longer waits for holiday drinks and popular Starbucks merchandise in the days leading up to Christmas, when many Americans will be off work and school or buying last-minute gifts.</p>



<p>Relations between the company and the union have turned frosty again, after a thaw earlier this year. In late February, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/starbucks-and-workers-united-union-agree-to-framework-for-talks.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both sides agreed</a> to work together on a &#8220;foundational framework&#8221; that would include a process to achieve collective bargaining agreements for individual stores. Since then, they&#8217;ve conducted more than nine bargaining sessions over 20 days, according to Starbucks.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Starbucks and the union met for the last scheduled bargaining session of the year. But ahead of the meeting, Starbucks Workers United baristas <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/17/starbucks-union-authorizes-strike-ahead-of-bargaining-session.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voted to authorize</a> a strike if the coffee giant didn&#8217;t propose a comprehensive package that would address pay and other benefits.</p>



<p>In the bargaining session, Starbucks proposed no immediate pay increase and only guaranteed annual pay hikes of 1.5% going forward, the union said.</p>



<p>Starbucks said in a statement that Workers United prematurely ended the bargaining session this week.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are ready to continue negotiations to reach agreements. We need the union to return to the table,&#8221; the company said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The union asked for a 64% increase to hourly employees&#8217; wages immediately and a 77% pay hike over the life of a three-year contract, according to Starbucks.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is not sustainable,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been a tough year for Starbucks. Globally and in the U.S., its sales have declined as consumers look elsewhere for their caffeine buzz. In the wake of the sales slump, baristas will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-12/how-much-does-starbucks-sbux-pay-raises-get-smaller-after-tough-year#:~:text=Raises%20for%20many%20Starbucks%20Corp,document%20seen%20by%20Bloomberg%20News." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly receive</a> a smaller annual pay hike next year than they have in previous years.</p>



<p>Starbucks Workers United represents more than 500 company-owned locations of Starbucks.</p>



<p>Starbucks baristas aren&#8217;t the only workers striking during the last-minute holiday rush. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a> workers across seven facilities <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/amazon-workers-strike-across-seven-facilities-during-holiday-shopping.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went on strike</a> on Thursday to put pressure on the e-commerce giant to come to the bargaining table.</p>

<p>Prices barely moved in November but still held higher than the Federal Reserve&#8217;s target when looked at from a year ago, according to a Commerce Department measure released Friday.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/pi1124.pdf">personal consumption expenditures price index</a>, the Fed&#8217;s preferred inflation gauge, showed an increase of just 0.1% from October. The measure indicated a 2.4% inflation rate on an annual basis, still ahead of the Fed&#8217;s 2% goal, but lower than the 2.5% estimate from Dow Jones. The monthly reading also was 0.1 percentage point below the forecast.</p>

<p>Excluding food and energy, core PCE also increased 0.1% monthly and was 2.8% higher from a year ago, with both readings also being 0.1 percentage point below the forecast. Fed officials generally consider the core reading to be a better gauge of long-run inflation trends as it excludes the volatile gas and groceries category.</p>

<p>The annual core inflation reading was the same as in October while the headline rate rose 0.1 percentage point.</p>

<p>The readings reflected little increase in goods prices and a 0.2% rise in services prices. Food and energy prices both posted 0.2% gains as well. On a 12-month basis, goods prices have fallen 0.4%, but services have risen 3.8%. Food prices were up 1.4% while energy fell 4%.</p>

<p>Housing inflation, one of the stickier components of inflation during his economic cycle, showed signs of cooling in November, rising just 0.2%.</p>

<p>Income and spending numbers in the release also were a bit light compared with expectations.</p>

<p>Personal income rose 0.3% after having jumped 0.7% in October, falling short of the 0.4% estimate. On spending, personal expenditures increased 0.4%, one-tenth of a percentage point below the forecast.</p>

<p>The personal saving rate edged lower to 4.4%.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078710">Stock market futures</a> held in negative territory after the report while Treasury yields also slumped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sticky inflation appeared to be a little less stuck this morning,&#8221; said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade Morgan Stanley. &#8220;The Fed&#8217;s preferred inflation gauge came in lower than expected, which may take some of the sting out of the market&#8217;s disappointment with the Fed&#8217;s interest rate announcement on Wednesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>The report comes just two days after the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate another quarter percentage point to a target range of 4.25%-4.5%, the lowest in two years. However, Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues reduced their expected path in 2025, now penciling in just two reductions compared with four indicated in September.</p>

<p>Though Powell said Wednesday that inflation has &#8220;moved much closer&#8221; to the Fed&#8217;s goal, he said the changes in the projected path for rate cuts reflects &#8220;the expectation inflation will be higher&#8221; in the year ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of common sense thinking that when the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower,&#8221; Powell said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<ul> <li>CEO exits at U.S. public companies hit a record in 2024 as they faced competitive and strategic challenges.</li> <li>Turnover included chief executives at U.S. companies that have long dominated in their industries — like Boeing, Nike and Starbucks.</li> <li>Consumer-focused companies, which are more susceptible to changing tastes and trends, generally have higher turnover than industries like oil and gas or utilities, which tend to have internal and longer-tenured CEOs.</li></ul>

<p>Retired, ousted or poached, CEOs headed for the exits this year.</p>

<p>U.S. public companies announced 327 chief executive changes this year through November, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s more than in any other year since at least 2010, when the firm first started tracking the turnover. It&#8217;s also an 8.6% increase from last year.</p>

<p>Turnover included CEOs at U.S. companies that have long dominated their industries — like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BA&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Boeing</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NKE&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Nike</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SBUX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Starbucks</a>. The pace of change points to those companies&#8217; customers, investors, hedge funds or boards growing impatient with sales slumps or strategic missteps in an otherwise strong economy when consumers proved they were <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2024/11/commerce-data-show-strong-economic-gains-due-americans-making-and-spending-more">willing to spend</a>.</p>

<p>CEO changes slowed during the pandemic, when companies were suddenly faced with lockdowns, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/working-from-home-is-now-mainstream-but-is-it-here-to-stay.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">remote work</a>, supply chain difficulties and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/heres-why-meat-shortages-are-likely-to-last-during-the-pandemic.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">shortages</a>, if not outright <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/23/coronavirus-airlines-lose-billions-as-demand-stalled-ceos-warn-recovery-hinges-on-a-vaccine.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">survival</a>. They later faced higher <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/fed-meeting-july-2023-.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">borrowing costs</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/wages-have-outstripped-cpi-inflation-for-a-year.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">inflation</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/17/customer-service-suffers-at-short-staffed-restaurants-as-covid-takes-toll.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">labor shortages</a>, shifting consumer <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/10/behind-americas-divided-economy-booming-luxury-travel-and-a-jump-in-relief-loans.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">preferences</a> and other challenges.</p>

<p>Over the past 14 years, 2021 had the lowest number of replacements at 197.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cost of capital, the speed of transformation, is creating faster turnover,&#8221; said Clarke Murphy, managing director and former chief executive of Russell Reynolds Associates, a leadership advisory firm.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/108078437-1734639388783-53rBI-ceo-departures-at-public-u-s-companies.png?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite></cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-text="" data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text"></span></span></div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Murphy said it was easier to stand out for poor performance in an otherwise strong market.</p>

<p>&#8220;In years of 20-plus-percent S&amp;P [500] returns two years in a row, any company that&#8217;s significantly underperforming, the spotlight has been on, and boards of directors moved faster than they might have moved five or seven years ago,&#8221; Murphy said.</p>

<p>Consumer-focused companies, which are more susceptible to changing tastes and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/14/free-first-class-upgrade-frequent-flyers.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">trends</a>, generally have higher turnover than industries like oil and gas or utilities, which tend to have internal and longer-tenured CEOs.</p>

<p>The recent spike in turnover comes even as the number of public companies has dropped.</p>

<p>Here are some of the major U.S. CEO changes so far this year:</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Intel</h4>

<p>The semiconductor company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/02/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-is-out.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger</a> earlier this month, nearly four years after he was appointed to turn the chipmaker around and better compete with rivals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/INTC&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Intel</a>&#8216;s stock price and market share had collapsed as the artificial intelligence wave boosted chipmaker <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Nvidia</a> while Intel struggled to crack into the business.</p>

<p>A successor hasn&#8217;t yet been named.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Boeing</h4>

<p>The aerospace giant announced former CEO Dave Calhoun&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/25/boeing-ceo-board-chair-commercial-head-out-737-max-crisis.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">departure</a> in March, part of a broad executive shake-up. It came nearly three months after an unsecured <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/06/ntsb-boeing-737-max-9-report-bolts-appeared-missing-from-alaska-air-plane.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">door plug blew off</a> midair from a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 operated by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ALK&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Alaska Airlines</a>, plunging the company back into a safety crisis after years of problems across its defense and commercial aerospace business, frustrating the leaders of some of its biggest airline customers.</p>

<p>Calhoun himself was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/boeing-stock-halted-pending-news-company-battles-fallout-737-max-crisis.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">appointed</a> in the last days of 2019 to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/what-to-know-about-new-boeing-ceo-david-calhoun.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">succeed</a> ex-CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who was ousted for his handling of the aftermath of two fatal crashes of Boeing&#8217;s 737 Max in 2018 and 2019.</p>

</figure>

<p>Calhoun was succeeded in August by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/23/boeing-ba-3q-2024-earnings.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Kelly Ortberg</a>, a three-decade aerospace veteran and former Rockwell Collins CEO, whom Boeing plucked out of retirement in Florida to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/08/new-boeing-ceo-kelly-ortberg.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">steady the company</a>.</p>

<p>In the midst of a labor strike, which ended last month, Ortberg announced thousands of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/boeing-layoffs-factory-strike.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">layoffs</a> and slashed costs elsewhere to conserve cash as Boeing works toward stabilizing production.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Starbucks</h4>

<p>With sales shrinking in its biggest markets, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SBUX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Starbucks</a> poached <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMG&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Chipotle Mexican Grill</a> star CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/13/starbucks-replaces-ceo-laxman-narasimhan-with-chipotle-ceo-brian-niccol.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Brian Niccol</a> to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/13/starbucks-replaces-ceo-laxman-narasimhan-with-chipotle-ceo-brian-niccol.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">turn around</a> the coffee chain&#8217;s fortunes, replacing Laxman Narasimhan. The company&#8217;s shares soared nearly 25% when Niccol&#8217;s appointment was announced in August.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/108055551-1730377852012-SG-Niccol-04.jpg?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="Brian Niccols, CEO of Starbucks, speaking with CNBC on Oct. 31st, 2024. " data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite>CNBC</cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-text="Brian Niccols, CEO of Starbucks, speaking with CNBC on Oct. 31st, 2024. " data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text">Brian Niccols, CEO of Starbucks, speaking with CNBC on Oct. 31st, 2024. </span></span></div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the 100 days since his appointment, he&#8217;s announced plans to bring the company &#8220;back to Starbucks&#8221; and refocus on what first attracted customers to the coffee chain. Early stages of the strategy include making its coffee shops more <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/starbucks-plan-to-return-to-its-roots-involves-200000-sharpies.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">welcoming</a>, trimming its lengthy menu and speeding up service.</p>

<p>Chipotle, meanwhile, named insider and industry veteran <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/11/chipotle-mexican-grill-names-scott-boatwright-as-permanent-ceo.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Scott Boatwright</a> to the Mexican food chain&#8217;s helm in November.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Nike</h4>

<p>The shoemaker replaced CEO John Donahoe <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/19/nike-ceo-john-donahoe-is-out-replaced-by-elliott-hill.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">in September</a> with Elliott Hill, a company veteran who started as an intern at Nike in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Donahue had helped Nike grow sales since he took the helm, from $39.1 billion in fiscal 2019 to $51.4 billion in fiscal 2024, but growth eventually stagnated after he moved away from wholesale partners like Foot Locker and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/M&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Macy</a>&#8216;s and lost sight of innovation.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Peloton</h4>

<div class="internal-link" id="a0NlVF9ahw"></div>

<p>A darling of the pandemic, the home fitness equipment company had struggled since return-to-office mandates started rolling in.</p>

<p>In 2022, Peloton brought in former Spotify and Netflix executive <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/08/peloton-ceo-john-foley-to-step-down-transition-to-executive-chair-as-company-cuts-2800-jobs-says-report.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Barry McCarthy</a> to take over for founder John Foley, but he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/02/peloton-ceo-barry-mccarthy-steps-down-15percent-of-staff-laid-off.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">stepped down</a> in May after the company announced yet another restructuring.</p>

<p>In October, Peloton announced <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/peloton-ceo-ford-exec-peter-stern.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Peter Stern</a>, a former <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/F&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Ford</a> executive and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Apple</a> Fitness+ co-founder as its third CEO. Stern has a background in growing subscription-based services, and Wall Street is hopeful he&#8217;ll bring Peloton to profitability by cutting costs and focusing on its high-margin subscription revenue.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Kohl&#8217;s</h4>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/108068544-1732656776162-gettyimages-2187027457-dji_20241126123817_0445_d_zsagjoil.jpeg?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="In an aerial view, a customer walks in front of a Kohl's store on November 26, 2024 in San Rafael, California. " data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite>Justin Sullivan | Getty Images</cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-text="In an aerial view, a customer walks in front of a Kohl's store on November 26, 2024 in San Rafael, California. " data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text">In an aerial view, a customer walks in front of a Kohl&#8217;s store on November 26, 2024 in San Rafael, California. </span></span></div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KSS&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">Kohl&#8217;s</a> CEO Tom Kingsbury <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/25/kohls-ceo-tom-kingsbury-to-step-down-replaced-by-ashley-buchanan.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">is stepping down</a> on Jan. 15, the off-mall department store said late last month, and he will be succeeded by Ashley Buchanan from crafting mecca Michaels.</p>

<p>Kohl&#8217;s has seen its comparable store sales, a key metric for retailers, drop in each of the past 11 quarters, and its stock price slumped.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">WW International</h4>

<p>The weight loss company formerly known as Weight Watchers announced in September that CEO Sima Sistani would step down immediately.</p>

<p>WW International has struggled, with shares falling more than 80% this year. It tired to reorient itself under Sistani&#8217;s tenure to include a platform that links customers with popular <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/healthy-returns-drugmakers-are-racing-to-develop-weight-loss-pills.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077066">weight loss</a> drugs.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p><strong>Warren Buffett</strong> went on bit of a shopping spree in the stock market before Christmas, picking up shares of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/OXY&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078685">Occidental Petroleum</a> among others during a swift December sell-off.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BRK.A&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078685">Berkshire Hathaway</a> purchased an additional 8.9 million shares in the Houston-based energy producer for $405 million through transactions Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, pushing its stake above 28%, according to a regulatory filing late Thursday night.</p>

<p>During the same time frame, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also bought about 5 million shares of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SIRI&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078685">Sirius XM</a> for around $113 million as well as about 234,000 shares of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/VRSN&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078685">VeriSign</a> for roughly $45 million. These two stakes are much smaller in size, so these transactions could be made by Buffett&#8217;s investing lieutenants Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.</p>

<p>All told, Berkshire bought more than $560 million worth of stocks over the last three sessions.</p>

<p>The 94-year-old legendary investor appeared to have taken advantage of a broad market pullback that made these stocks much cheaper.</p>

<p>Occidental shares have dropped more than 10% this month, bringing its 2024 losses to 24%. The energy company, once known for being founded by legendary oilman Armand Hammer, is Berkshire&#8217;s sixth-biggest equity holding. Buffett has ruled out a full takeover.</p>

<p>The sell-off in Sirius XM has been more dramatic. The New York-based satellite radio company is currently in a six-day losing streak, falling 23% this month and 62% this year.</p>

<p>Berkshire started hiking this bet after billionaire John Malone&#8217;s Liberty Media completed its deal <a href="https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/542/liberty-media-and-sirius-xm-announce-final-exchange-ratio">in early September</a> to combine its tracking stocks with the rest of the audio entertainment company. Now, Berkshire&#8217;s stake has risen to about 35%. SiriusXM has been grappling with subscriber losses and unfavorable demographic shifts.</p>

<p>Internet name VeriSign has also had a rough year with its stock down 6% in 2024, significantly underperforming the tech sector. Berkshire first bought the tech stock in 2013 and hasn&#8217;t adjusted the stake in years.</p>

<p><em>Correction: Warren Buffett is 94 years old. An earlier version misstated his age.</em></p>

<p>Alexis Ohanian built Reddit right after college and sold the company a year later for $10 million. In 2020, he launched his own start-up venture capital fund called 776. But the 41-year-old tech executive might have been even more successful had he mastered discipline in his younger years, he told the &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOtQEKvQ9wU">On Purpose with Jay Shetty</a>&#8221; podcast on Monday.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I had free time, when I had more youthful vigor, if I had more discipline, I would have been 10 times more productive,&#8221; Ohanian said. &#8220;That&#8217;s one thing I would give advice to myself at 20 about.&#8221;</p>

<p>For example, as a student and young entrepreneur, Ohanian stayed up for hours trying to finish work that would have taken him 20 minutes the next day had he gone to bed at a reasonable time, he said. </p>

<p>His drive was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/alexis-ohanian-reflects-on-selling-reddit-for-10-million.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077926">strongly fueled</a> by a desire for his mom to see him become a successful CEO, as she battled with stage four terminal brain cancer. Looking back, however, Ohanian recognizes that his lifestyle was unsustainable and unhealthy, and contributed to stress and burnout. </p>

<p>&#8220;When I was in my 20s, I was perpetually in &#8216;CEO Mode&#8217; and could never find a healthy work/life balance,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexisohanian_when-i-was-in-my-20s-i-was-perpetually-in-activity-7092187225844498432-k8Ql/?trk=public_profile_like_view">posted to LinkedIn</a> last year. &#8220;Plus, I never thought about what I ate, drank, or [smoked] &#8230; how often I exercised, etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>Becoming a father to his now 7-year-old daughter opened his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we had Olympia, I knew I needed to change everything so I can be around for as long as possible for her,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;I began a discipline of daily routines to help me move towards my goals, regardless of if I&#8217;m at home or on the road: cold plunges, working out, goal-setting, etc.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Building discipline while young is crucial</h4>

<p>Cultivating discipline by age 27 can be an essential part of being successful and leading a fulfilling life, author and psychiatrist Phil Stutz said on an episode of the &#8220;<a href="https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/phil-stutz">Armchair Expert</a>&#8221; podcast last year. The habit of creating and sticking to routines, like Ohanian now does, can lead to increased productivity, more organization, and better time-management.</p>

<p>Figure out what kind of routine and discipline works best for you, your life and your professional goals, Ohanian says, and be intentional about sticking to those standards going forward. </p>

<p>&#8220;Creating a discipline of daily routines can look different for each person across different stages of their life,&#8221; Ohanian wrote. &#8220;What matters most is that you&#8217;re aware of what your body needs and are taking steps to address it.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>If you enjoy teaching and are looking for a side hustle — or full-time job — that you can do from home, you might want to consider tutoring. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/in-demand-side-hustle-for-2023-is-online-tutoring-how-to-start.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077863">Demand for online tutors has surged</a> in recent years, driven by pandemic disruptions to in-person learning, declining test scores in core subjects, and increasingly competitive college admissions.</p>

<p>While the need for online tutoring services &#8220;might not be as intense&#8221; as it was during the height of the pandemic, &#8220;it&#8217;s still strong,&#8221; Kathy Kristof, founder and editor of <a href="https://sidehusl.com/">SideHusl.com</a>, tells <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077863">CNBC Make It</a>. </p>

<p>&#8220;Tutors can earn anywhere from $15 to more than $150 an hour, depending on the subject that they teach,&#8221; she adds. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;It&#8217;s a great side hustle&#8217;</h4>

<p>Tutoring is a popular because it allows you to &#8220;set your own rates and availability,&#8221; says Kristof. There&#8217;s no shortage of subjects to teach, whether academic or non-academic, and a variety of platforms to choose from. &#8220;It really is a great side hustle,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>On Outschool, a marketplace for virtual classes for children, for example, one tutor offers sessions on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, while another teaches tambourine and hand drum lessons.</p>

<p>That said, &#8220;there&#8217;s especially strong demand&#8221; for tutors in STEM subjects and for helping students prepare for standardized tests like the SAT and ACT, Kristof notes.</p>

<p>Alicia Carpenter, a tutor and president of Forum Education, a New York-based tutoring agency, says Forum has seen an increase in requests for writing and analytical reading support post-pandemic. &#8220;The aftereffects of remote schooling and isolation have created a real writing skills crisis, affecting students from grade school all the way through college,&#8221; she explains.</p>

<p>Among the platforms Kristof recommends is Wyzant, which she describes as &#8220;well-established&#8221; and capable of attracting &#8220;millions of visitors&#8221; each month. That makes it easier to find clients. </p>

<p>Other popular platforms include Varsity Tutors and Udemy, where you can create and sell pre-recorded courses.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to start tutoring without a teaching background</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/28/millennial-quit-wall-street-job-now-earns-1000-dollars-an-hour-from-home.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077863">Steve Menking</a> was working as an equities trader at SMB Capital with no background in education before he became a full-time tutor in 2014. The years he spent on Wall Street prepared him well to tutor high school and college students in subjects such as accounting and calculus, he says. </p>

<p>He&#8217;s built a thriving career with two main income streams: contracting with Forum Education and running his own online business, Menking Tutoring LLC, which he launched in 2020.</p>

<p>In 2023, Menking earned more than $500,000 through private tutoring, a number he&#8217;s on track to match in 2024. His current rate is about $1,000 an hour.</p>

<p>His advice for aspiring tutors? Find a niche subject you excel in. For example, if you work in marketing, you might specialize in English tutoring or helping students craft college admissions essays.</p>

<p>Before committing to one platform or agency, Menking recommends exploring multiple options to see which offers the best rates and access to students.</p>

<p>After leaving finance, Menking submitted his resume to dozens of tutoring agencies in New York and created a profile on Wyzant. He initially set his rate at just under $100 an hour but increased it as he gained experience and referrals. By 2017, he was charging $150 an hour.</p>

<p>The &#8220;most important&#8221; skill for successful tutoring, Menking says, isn&#8217;t a degree in education — though that can certainly help. Instead, &#8220;what&#8217;s helped me the most is a willingness to understand how different people learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can upskill in a number of subjects with books, podcasts and other resources, but what sets the best tutors apart is their ability to actively listen, be patient and genuinely care about helping someone learn the material,&#8221; Menking adds.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">S&amp;P 500</a> and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.NDX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">Nasdaq-100</a> indexes get new members added and old ones kicked out on Friday in a quarterly rebalancing mostly based on companies&#8217; adjusted market capitalization. </p>

<p>Years ago, these index reconstitutions had very little impact on trading. </p>

<p>Not anymore. </p>

<p>The explosion of index-based ETFs has changed all that. </p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/index-news-and-announcements/spdji-indexed-asset-survey-2023.pdf">roughly $16 trillion is indexed to the S&amp;P 500</a>. </p>

<p>The largest Nasdaq-100 ETF (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/QQQ&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">QQQ</a>), has $321 billion in assets, and the Invesco Nasdaq-100 Index mutual fund (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">IVNQX</a>) has about $100 billion in assets, so we are talking well north of $400 billion in additional assets pegged to the Nasdaq-100. </p>

<p>Bottom line: what stocks are added to or deleted from these large indexes matters a lot. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Palantir gets its wish</strong></h3>

<p>If you doubt that being included in a large index matters, just ask <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PLTR&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">Palantir Technologies</a>. It apparently believes it is very important. </p>

<p>On November 14, the company issued a three-sentence (!) press release announcing that it was transferring its listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Stock Market. Palantir concluded with this: &#8220;Upon transferring, Palantir <a href="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2024/Palantir-Announces-Transfer-of-Stock-Exchange-Listing-to-Nasdaq/">anticipates meeting the eligibility requirements</a> of the Nasdaq-100 Index.&#8221; </p>

<p>Can&#8217;t make it any plainer than that. </p>

<p>And Palantir got its wish. It&#8217;s being added to the Nasdaq-100 at the close of trading on Friday. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase denied</strong> </h3>

<p>Two companies are being added to the S&amp;P 500: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/APO&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">Apollo Global Management</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WDAY&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">Workday</a>. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/QRVO&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">Qorvo</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">Amentum</a> are being removed. </p>

<p>Most people think the S&amp;P 500 is the 500 largest companies in the United States, but it&#8217;s more complicated than that. There are a number of requirements that have to be met to get into the S&amp;P 500, including a minimum market capitalization of $18 billion. </p>

<p>However, there is no obligation to mechanically include only the 500 largest companies by market capitalization: &#8220;Constituent selection is at the discretion of the Index Committee and is based on the eligibility criteria,&#8221; <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf">S&amp;P Global&#8217;s methodology paper</a> says. </p>

<p>For S&amp;P, adding Apollo (financials) and Workday (technology) are relatively safe choices. At $96 billion and $70 billion in market cap, both are squarely in the large-cap segment of the market. </p>

<p>Still, many investors were hoping that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/COIN&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">Coinbase Global</a>, which has a similar market cap to Workday ($68 billion)  would be added to the S&amp;P 500. It certainly qualifies based on market capitalization and profitability (it&#8217;s been profitable the last four quarters). But Coinbase is a far more volatile stock than either Apollo or Workday. </p>

<p>Coinbase did not make the cut. It&#8217;s not clear why, but perhaps because the S&amp;P Index Committee was concerned about the volatility. Coinbase is one of the most volatile of all stocks. This year alone, it has moved from a low of $117 to about $350, a 200% move. </p>

<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s a coincidence, but Coinbase was down 9% the day after the S&amp;P inclusion announcement was made, and the cryptocurrency platform was excluded. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MicroStrategy sector</strong></h3>

<p>Sometimes just determining where a stock should be classified can be a big issue, especially when big money is involved. </p>

<p>Going into the Nasdaq-100 are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSTR&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">MicroStrategy</a>, Palantir and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXON&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">Axon Enterprise</a>. Going out are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ILMN&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">Illumina</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SMCI&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">Super Micro Computer</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MRNA&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078518">Moderna</a>. </p>

<p>To enter the Nasdaq-100, a company has to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global Market, have a free float of at least 10% and, while there is no minimum or maximum market capitalization requirement, the annual reconstitution (determining who goes in and out), is loosely based on market capitalization: &#8220;The Nasdaq-100 Index is designed to measure the performance of 100 of the largest Nasdaq-listed non-financial companies,&#8221; Nasdaq says in <a href="https://indexes.nasdaq.com/docs/Methodology_NDX.pdf">its Index Methodology paper</a>. </p>

<p>Note the requirement that any entrant be a &#8220;non-financial stock.&#8221; </p>

<p>Based on market capitalization, MicroStrategy has certainly earned its spot in the Nasdaq-100. It has been a monster this year, up over 400%, and now sports a market cap of about $80 billion. That alone would put MicroStrategy in the top half of the Nasdaq-100 by market value. </p>

<p>Like Coinbase, it is a very volatile stock (trading range in 2024:  $50 to $500). </p>

<p>More interesting is the fact that MicroStrategy is listed as a technology stock, but given that about half its value is in bitcoin (it owns 439,000 bitcoin with a current value about $42 billion), is it accurate to call it a tech stock? </p>

<p>Chairman Michael Saylor has said he wants to run <a href="https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/microstrategys-bold-pursuit-of-a-1-trillion-bitcoin-bank-valuation">MicroStrategy as a &#8220;bitcoin bank.&#8221;</a> </p>

<p>Should we take him at his word? Should MicroStrategy be classified as a financial stock, which would make it ineligible to be in the Nasdaq-100? </p>

<p>For the moment, it&#8217;s classified as a technology stock. Whether it stays there is uncertain. There&#8217;s this thing called the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB), which is the system developed to categorize public companies into specific industries and sectors. There are periodic reviews to make sure companies are in their appropriate sectors. </p>

<p>But that is for another day. For the moment, Bitcoin fans are loving it. Their darling is in the Nasdaq-100. </p>

<p>Whether index fans will love it is yet to be determined.</p>

<ul> <li>Bitcoin fell sharply on Friday amid broader caution in risk assets.</li> <li>Bitcoin traded at around $92,808.07 at 6:57 a.m. ET on Friday, down around 9% from 24 hours before where it was priced above $102,000, according to Coin Metrics.</li> <li>The cryptocurrency hit an all-time high above $108,000 just this week, but has since sold off aggressively.</li></ul>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BTC.CM=&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078672">Bitcoin</a> fell sharply on Friday amid broader investor caution toward risk assets.</p>

<p>Bitcoin dipped below the $93,000 mark earlier in the day before trading above that price in volatile trade.</p>

<p>The digital asset was last trading at $97,491.71, according to Coin Metrics, down around 5% from 24 hours before when it was priced above $102,000.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency hit an all-time high above $108,000 just this week, but has since sold off aggressively.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve rattled markets in recent days, as it signaled fewer interest rate cuts next year. Equity markets took a hit, filtering through to crypto assets.</p>

<p>The price of bitcoin has more than doubled this year, supported by several factors including the launch of spot exchange-traded funds and the U.S. presidential election win of Donald Trump. He has pledged pro-crypto policies and his victory at the polls helped propel bitcoin to its latest record high.</p>

<p>With some markets on edge due to the Fed, some of the steam has come out of assets that have seen big gains this year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078672">Tesla</a>, which has been another big beneficiary of Trump&#8217;s win, continued its postelection slide with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/tesla-shares-drop-5percent-continuing-to-slide-as-post-election-rally-loses-steam.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078672">shares falling on Friday</a> in premarket trade.

<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s fall also dragged down other cryptocurrencies. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ETH.CM=&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078672">Ether</a> was down around 9%, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XRP.CM=&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078672">XRP</a> plunged 10% from 24 hours prior.</p>

<p><em>Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:</em></p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Friday frights</h4>

<p>Stock futures fell on Friday as traders awaited the latest reading of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s favorite inflation gauge: the personal consumption expenditures price index. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@ND.1&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078219">Nasdaq 100 futures</a> dropped 267.75 points, or 1.25%, while <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@SP.1&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078219">S&amp;P 500 futures</a> slid 0.75% and futures tied to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@DJ.1&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078219">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> dropped 0.55%. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078219">Follow live market updates</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Shutdown still looms</h4>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/108078565-1734652894930-gettyimages-2190746482-_d2_9728_cpldzhmd.jpeg?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks to reporters outside of the House Chambers in the U.S. Capitol on December 19, 2024 in Washington, DC. " data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite>Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images</cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-text="U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks to reporters outside of the House Chambers in the U.S. Capitol on December 19, 2024 in Washington, DC. " data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text">U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks to reporters outside of the House Chambers in the U.S. Capitol on December 19, 2024 in Washington, DC. </span></span></div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A House Republican deal for a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-republicans-say-they-have-deal-to-avert-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078219">three-month federal funding plan endorsed by President-elect Donald</a> Trump failed Thursday night, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-gop-trump-musk-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078219">a partial shutdown</a> is set to begin late Friday night. The plan would have suspended the U.S. debt ceiling for two years, but a total of 38 Republicans voted against the bill created by their own party&#8217;s leaders. That suspension was a surprising last-minute addition to the proposal, as increasing the debt ceiling typically requires months of negotiations. Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk harshly criticized a prior funding proposal Wednesday, sending Republicans scrambling on Thursday for a replacement plan.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Primetime strike</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078219">Amazon</a> workers across seven facilities in New York, Georgia, California and Illinois went on strike Thursday, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/amazon-workers-strike-across-seven-facilities-during-holiday-shopping.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078219">to pressure </a>Amazon to the negotiating table and avoid disruptions during the peak of the holiday shopping season. The strike was organized by members of the Teamsters to fight for better benefits, higher wages and safer working conditions. The union said Thursday&#8217;s campaign is the largest strike against Amazon in American history. But in a statement to CNBC, an Amazon spokesperson claimed the protesters at the sites are &#8220;almost entirely outsiders.&#8221; The Teamsters website says that nearly 10,000 Amazon workers have joined the organization, which represents less than 1% of the company&#8217;s workforce as of Dec. 31, 2023.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Goodbye discounts</h4>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/108077586-1734535739855-gettyimages-2189176447-1020_48_nn-blackfriday-72.jpeg?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="The Puerto Venecia shopping center is packed with people during the Black Friday sales week, Zaragoza, Spain. " data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite>Vw Pics | Universal Images Group | Getty Images</cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-text="The Puerto Venecia shopping center is packed with people during the Black Friday sales week, Zaragoza, Spain. " data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text">The Puerto Venecia shopping center is packed with people during the Black Friday sales week, Zaragoza, Spain. </span></span></div></figcaption>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NKE&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078219">Nike</a> on Thursday <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/nike-nke-earnings-q2-2025.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078219">reported quarterly earnings </a>that beat Wall Street expectations, while revenue and profit were down year over year. New CEO Elliott Hill blamed deep discounting for declining revenue, which fell to $12.35 billion, about 8% down from $13.39 billion a year earlier. Hill and finance chief Matt Friend said the retailer plans to return its online business to a full-price model but will need to first aggressively liquidate old inventory through &#8220;less profitable channels.&#8221; The company expects gross margins to be down between 3 and 3.5 percentage points during the holiday quarter.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Deck the food halls</h4>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/108077201-1734468307198-gettyimages-1924871809-289465final.jpeg?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="Neon sign of The Cheesecake Factory restaurant glowing at dusk, Westfield Mall, San Jose, California, December 2, 2023. " data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite>Smith Collection | Gado | Archive Photos | Getty Images</cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-text="Neon sign of The Cheesecake Factory restaurant glowing at dusk, Westfield Mall, San Jose, California, December 2, 2023. " data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text">Neon sign of The Cheesecake Factory restaurant glowing at dusk, Westfield Mall, San Jose, California, December 2, 2023. </span></span></div></figcaption>

<p>Restaurants and bars are taking up<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/mall-restaurants-like-cheesecake-factory-eataly-help-to-draw-shoppers.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078219"> more square footage in malls</a> in the hopes that diners will shop after eating. Yelp found that 17 of the 25 most popular mall brands, based on consumer interest, were restaurants, according to a <a href="https://trends.yelp.com/evolution-of-the-mall-report.html">report published</a> in October. The Cheesecake Factory found itself at the top of the list, along with other familiar names including Panera Bread and Olive Garden. But many malls also offer a much wider selection of eateries and refreshments than before, from regional restaurants to local chefs and emerging bubble tea chains. Specialty options, including the Italian chain Eataly, have spearheaded malls&#8217; transition away from food courts and into a more upscale alternative, food halls.</p>

<ul> <li>Shares of Novo Nordisk plummeted roughly 20% on Friday.</li> <li>The fall comes after the Danish pharmaceutical giant reported results in a late-stage trial for its experimental CagriSema weight loss drug that missed expectations.</li> <li>In comments to CNBC, however, Novo said that CagriSema had outperformed Wegovy in weight reduction and that its performance was &#8220;on par with best-in-class treatments.&#8221;</li></ul>

<p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVO&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078661">Novo Nordisk</a> plummeted roughly 20% on Friday after reporting results in a late-stage trial for its experimental CagriSema weight loss drug that missed expectations.</p>

<p>The maker of the wildly popular Wegovy obesity drug said its new drug candidate helped patients reduce their weight by 22.7%, below the 25% it told CNBC it had previously forecast.</p>

<p>Shares of rival obesity drug maker <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LLY&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078661">Eli Lilly</a> jumped more than 5% in early trading.</p>

<p>The trial results deal a blow to expectations that CagriSema could become a next-generation obesity drug. The two-drug injectable treatment combines semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, along with amylin analog Cagrilintide, a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/wegovy-and-zepound-rival-targets-next-generation-of-obesity-drugs-zealand-pharma.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078661">nascent form of weight loss treatment.</a></p>

<p>In comments to CNBC, however, Novo said that CagriSema had outperformed Wegovy in weight reduction and that its performance was &#8220;on par with best-in-class treatments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are encouraged by the weight loss profile of CagriSema demonstrating superiority over both semaglutide and cagrilintide in monotherapy in the REDEFINE 1 trial. This was achieved even though only 57% of patients reached the highest CagriSema dose,&#8221; Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for development at Novo Nordisk, said in a separate press release.</p>

<p>&#8220;With the insights obtained from the REDEFINE 1 trial, we plan to further explore the additional weight loss potential of CagriSema,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>The phase three trial was based on around 3,400 people with obesity, or who were overweight with one or more comorbidities, and took place over 68 weeks. It followed a flexible protocol, meaning patients could modify their dosage throughout the trial. By the end, just 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dose.</p>

<p>Novo said that top-line and full results will be presented next year and that it expects regulatory submission of the drug by the end of 2025. Results from a second phase 3 trial, REDEFINE 2, based on adults with Type 2 diabetes who are either obese or overweight, are also expected during the first half of next year.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;Efficacy in line with expectations&#8217;</h4>

<p>Soren Lontoft, pharma equity analyst at Sydbank, told CNBC that the share reaction on Friday was warranted for those who see the future of the market defined solely by total weight reduction.</p>

<p>However, he pointed to growing segmentation within the market — including among those who cannot tolerate traditional GLP-1s and those who prefer lesser weight loss — with some people more drawn to alternative options.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think the obesity market will be defined by a portfolio of medications going forward to address different needs then you shouldn&#8217;t be downbeat about these data,&#8221; he said over the phone.</p>

<p>In a note Friday, JPMorgan acknowledged that while the results were disappointing, it continued to see strong potential for the nascent amylin analog drug group to emerge as the next phase of obesity treatment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though the headline weight loss for CagriSema combo was below expectations, potentially due to patients modifying their dose down for the combo, we believe the Amylin mono headline data shows efficacy in line with expectations and good tolerability, which provide validation of Amylin mono as a treatment approach,&#8221; the analysts wrote.</p>

<p>They added that the findings provide support for similar amylin analog drugs from competitor <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/">Zealand Pharma</a>, whose treatment they described as potentially more efficacious than CagriSema. Zealand&#8217;s CEO, Adam Steensberg, told CNBC in October that its Petrelintide drug was its &#8220;crown jewel&#8221; and that it was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/wegovy-and-zepound-rival-targets-next-generation-of-obesity-drugs-zealand-pharma.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078661">seeking a partner</a> to bring it to market.</p>

<p>JPMorgan said it now expects a Zealand Pharma partnership as soon as next year.</p>

<p>It comes as competition continues to heat up in the weight loss drug market, with more players <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/25/roche-wegovy-obesity-rival-to-be-part-of-a-suite-of-weight-loss-drugs.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078661">joining the fray</a> amid surging demand.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Novo faced another setback when a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/eli-lilly-zepbound-causes-more-weight-loss-than-novo-nordisk-wegovy-trial.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078661">head-to-head clinical trial</a> showed Eli Lilly&#8217;s Zepbound resulted in superior weight loss compared with Wegovy.</p>

<p>The trial, sponsored by Lilly, showed Zepbound helped patients shed 20.2%, or roughly 50 pounds, on average after 72 weeks, while Wegovy helped them lose a lesser 13.7% on average over the same period. Novo said at the time that it was awaiting the complete data.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<ul> <li>Russia&#8217;s central bank on Friday unexpectedly left its key interest rates unchanged at 21%, citing improved monetary tightness that had created the conditions to tame sky-high inflation.</li> <li>Markets had widely expected the central bank to hike interest rates by another 200 basis on Friday, after taking such a step in October.</li> <li>Russia&#8217;s consumer price index hit 8.9% in November on an annual basis, up from 8.5% in October. </li></ul>

<p>Russia&#8217;s central bank on Friday unexpectedly left its key interest rates unchanged at 21%, citing improved monetary tightness that had created the conditions to tame sky-high inflation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monetary conditions tightened more significantly than envisaged by the October key rate decision,&#8221; the bank <a href="https://www.cbr.ru/eng/press/pr/?file=20122024_133000key_eng.htm">said</a>, noting factors &#8220;autonomous&#8221; from its monetary policy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Given the notable increase in interest rates for borrowers and the cooling of credit activity, the achieved tightness of monetary conditions creates the necessary prerequisites for resuming disinflation processes and returning inflation to the target, despite the elevated current price growth and high domestic demand,&#8221; it added.</p>

<p>Markets had widely expected the central bank to hike interest rates by another 200 basis on Friday, after taking such a step in October amid an ongoing effort to subdue inflation stoked by the military costs of Moscow&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and by Western sanctions against its key commodity exports.</p>

<p>The bank on Friday said it would assess the need for a key rate increase at its upcoming meeting in February. It currently forecasts annual inflation will decline to 4% in 2026 and remain at this target in the forward horizon.</p>

<p>Russia&#8217;s consumer price index is currently more than twice this rate — annual inflation hit 9.5% as of Dec. 16, the bank said Friday, noting persisting pressures, especially in the household and business sectors. The consumer price index hit 8.9% in November on an annual basis, up from 8.5% in October. The increase was largely driven by rising food prices, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/25/russias-inflation-is-so-bad-that-people-are-stealing-butter.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078666">with the cost of milk and dairy products soaring </a>this year.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Inflation an &#8216;alarming signal&#8217;</h4>

<p>The hold to interest rates comes even after Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted during his Thursday annual Q&amp;A session with Russian citizens that the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/putin-admits-russian-inflation-is-alarming-and-economy-overheating.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078666">nation&#8217;s inflation was problematic</a> and that there was evidence of the economy overheating. He nevertheless stressed that Russia could still achieve 3.9%-4% of economic growth this year.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, inflation is such an alarming signal. Just yesterday, when I was preparing for today&#8217;s event, I spoke with the chairperson of the Central Bank, Elvira [Nabiullina] who told me that it was already somewhere around 9.3%. But wages have grown by 9% in real terms, I want to emphasize this — in real terms minus inflation — and the disposable income of the population has also grown,&#8221; he said, according to comments reported by Interfax and translated by Google.</p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund predicts Russia will notch 3.6% growth this year, before a deceleration to 1.3% growth in 2025.</p>

<p>The &#8220;sharp slowdown,&#8221; the IMF said, was envisaged &#8220;as private consumption and investment slow amid reduced tightness in the labor market and slower wage growth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What we are seeing right now in the Russian economy, [is] that it is pushing against capacity constraint,&#8221; Alfred Kammer, director of the European Department at the IMF, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/10/24/tr102424-transcript-of-eur-reo">said when the fund released its latest economic outlook</a> in October.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we have a positive output gap, or you could put it differently — the Russian economy is overheating. What we are expecting for next year is simply also the impact that going over your supply capacity, you cannot maintain for very long. So we see an impact on moving into more normal territory there. And of course, that is supported by a tight monetary policy by the Central Bank of Russia,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;A tight monetary policy, in order to bring down inflation, slows down aggregate demand, and in 2025 will have these effects on GDP. That&#8217;s why we are seeing the slowdown in 2025,&#8221; Kammer added.</p>

<ul> <li>Tesla shares turned higher on Friday, reversing losses from earlier in the day.</li> <li>On Wednesday, Tesla shares slumped 8% to record their worst day since before Donald Trump&#8217;s presidential election victory.</li> <li>The stock is still up around 72% since the night of the U.S. presidential vote.</li></ul>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078652">Tesla</a> on Friday reversed losses from earlier in the day to turn higher, as the electric vehicle maker&#8217;s shares looked to wrap up a volatile week of trading.</p>

<p>Shares were up 0.7% as of 11:10 a.m. ET, erasing losses from earlier in the day — at one point, Tesla earlier shed as much as 6% in U.S. premarket trading.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Tesla shares slumped 8% to post their worst day since before <strong>Donald Trump&#8217;s</strong> presidential election victory in November. For the week, Tesla shares are still down slightly.</p>

<p>Trump&#8217;s win prompted a sharp rally in Tesla shares, as investors increased their bets that the electric vehicle firm would benefit thanks to its CEO Elon Musk&#8217;s close ties to the president-elect.</p>

<p>The stock is still up around 72% since Nov. 5&#8217;s market close — the night of the U.S. presidential vote.</p>

<p>Musk was appointed by Trump to co-lead the newly created <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/trump-says-musk-and-ramaswamy-will-lead-government-efficiency-group.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078652">Department of Government Efficiency</a>, also referred to as &#8220;DOGE.&#8221; The proposed presidential advisory commission&#8217;s acronym shares the same name as the internet meme that inspired so-called &#8220;memecoin&#8221; cryptocurrency, dogecoin.</p>

<p>Dogecoin <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/06/doges-musk-ramaswamy-try-to-sell-congress-on-huge-spending-cuts.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078652">briefly shot up in price</a> after the body&#8217;s creation.</p>

<p>Musk was a major backer of Trump during the Republican&#8217;s election run, pouring in $277 million primarily into his campaign effort, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Musk is the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/">world&#8217;s richest person</a>, with a net worth of $439.4 billion, according to Forbes data.</p>

<p>Last month, Bloomberg News reported Trump&#8217;s transition team was planning to pursue a federal framework for regulating self-driving vehicles.</p>

<p>Tesla and Trump&#8217;s transition team did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on the report.</p>

<p>If true, the move would offer a major boost to Musk&#8217;s EV firm. Tesla is staking its future on the idea of rolling out mass fleets of autonomous vehicles, known as &#8220;robotaxi&#8221; services. At the firm&#8217;s &#8220;We Robot&#8221; event in October, Musk <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/10/elon-musk-hypes-a-30000-tesla-cybercab-robovan-at-robotaxi-event.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078652">unveiled the firm&#8217;s Cybercab self-driving concept car</a>.</p>

<p>Tesla has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/03/dont-rate-teslas-full-self-driving-too-highly-tech-investor-says.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078652">yet to deliver on Musk&#8217;s promise of offering truly autonomous vehicles</a>. Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot and paid &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; services still require a human behind the wheel to supervise the system&#8217;s actions and take over if needed.</p>

<p>In other Tesla-related news, data released by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association on Thursday showed sales of Tesla cars declined 40.9% in November, exceeding the overall 9.5% dip in sales of battery electric cars (BEVs) in the bloc.</p>

<p>Separately, Tesla also on Friday said it was recalling nearly 700,000 vehicles in the U.S. due to an issue with its tire pressure monitoring system. Software-related recalls aren&#8217;t typically a huge issue for Tesla, however, as it can issue &#8220;over-the-air&#8221; updates to fix these issues.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The 10-year Treasury yield retreated on Friday as a key inflation gauge showed cooler-than-expected price pressures. Mid-morning remarks by Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, confirming that rates could still decline next year despite the central bank&#8217;s cautious stance, also helped lift bond prices.</p>

<p>The yield on the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y/">10-year Treasury</a> fell 5 basis points to 4.516% after topping 4.57% the previous day. The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US2Y/">2-year Treasury</a> yield dipped 1.5 basis points to 4.304%.The benchmark 10-year yield is still about 0.10% higher than the 4.40% level where it ended last week.</p>

<p>One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p>

<p>The November personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed&#8217;s preferred measure of inflation, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/pce-inflation-november-2024-.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078644">increased just 0.1% from October</a>. The gauge indicated a 2.4% inflation rate on an annual basis, still ahead of the Fed&#8217;s 2% goal but lower than the 2.5% estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The monthly reading also was 0.1 percentage point below the forecast.</p>

<p>Later in the day, Chicago Federal Reserve President Goolsbee reassured investors by telling CNBC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/steve-liesman/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078644">Steve Liesman</a> that inflation continues to come under control.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still on path to get to 2% and at least for this new month you don&#8217;t want to make too much out of any one month, but I&#8217;m hopeful that this suggests that the couple of months of firming were more of a bump than a change in path,&#8221; Goolsbee said.</p>

<p>Treasury yields surged on Wednesday after Fed policymakers increased their inflation forecast for the coming year and pointed to only two potential rate cuts in 2025, down from four potential cuts that had been signaled in September.</p>

<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell flagged at a press conference after the central bank meeting that the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/investors-need-to-adjust-rate-outlook-but-shouldnt-panic-datatreks-colas-says.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078644">12-month inflation rate</a> will top the central bank&#8217;s 2% goal, estimating 2.5% for headline inflation and 2.8% for the core level, which excludes food and energy prices. Powell nevertheless said the monthly move will be &#8220;much lower&#8221; than in previous months.</p>

<p>The U.S. government is currently on the brink of a shutdown as dozens of Republicans voted against a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-republicans-say-they-have-deal-to-avert-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078644">spending bill backed by President-elect Trump. </a>The House Republican deal would have funded the government for three months and suspended the debt ceiling for two years.</p>

<p>Without an agreement, a partial government shutdown is expected to begin Friday night.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Germany&#8217;s stock market is massively outperforming its European peers this year and moving in lockstep with U.S. equities.</p>

<p>The main market, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.GDAXI&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078078">DAX 30</a>, is up about 19% so far this year, compared with the 5% hike of the European benchmark, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.STOXX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078078">Stoxx 600</a>. The gains in Germany are closer to performances seen stateside, where the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078078">S&amp;P</a> is up about 23% year-to-date.</p>

<p>Several reasons underpin these gains, including low expectations at the start of the year, the exposure to the United States economy and the upcoming snap election, analysts told CNBC.</p>

<p>Sabrina Reeh, senior portfolio manager at DWS, told CNBC on Wednesday that valuations were relatively low at the start of the year and the sentiment was &#8220;muted&#8221; across Germany equities, but that earnings developments ultimately came in &#8220;better than expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>One stock in particular propelled the German market: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SAP&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078078">SAP</a>, whose shares rose nearly 59% this year. Maximilian Uleer, head of European equity and cross asset strategy at Deutsche Bank, told CNBC that the company has contributed 8% to the year-to-date performance of the German market.</p>

<p>In late October, for instance, SAP shares hit an all-time high after the company raised its full-year targets and posted strong numbers for it cloud business. At the time, CEO Christian Klein said SAP was &#8220;confidently&#8221; raising the outlook and added &#8220;we are making strong progress on Business AI.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stock has kept gaining ground since the results.</p>

<p>The success of German equities this year is also related to their exposure to the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;DAX companies generate a higher share of their revenue in the U.S. than in Germany. Despite concerns about potential tariffs, a significant portion of that revenue is produced local for local and likely not subject to tariffs,&#8221; Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Uleer said.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Snap Election: A positive surprise</h4>

<p>Though the collapse of the German government in November largely emerged as a surprise, analysts recognize the development could become a positive for equities.</p>

<p>&#8220;From a market perspective, snap elections are perceived as an opportunity for more structural reforms and higher spending, be it via a shift within governmental spending priorities or via a higher fiscal deficit,&#8221; Uleer also said.</p>

<p>This is particularly relevant when manufacturing, traditionally a big component of the German economy, has been hit hard throughout 2024. The latest PMI data showed further contraction for the embattled sector in December.</p>

<p>DWS&#8217; Reeh mentioned how the snap election helped with the overall sentiment toward the German market.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know the actual political agenda,&#8221; she said, noting it is unclear how many parties will be forming the upcoming government, but lower regulations and relaxing the debt brake may help improve sentiment.</p>

<p>Germany is now holding conversations about easing its famous debt brake, which stipulates strict debt targets. It is so far unclear how much more Berlin is willing to spend, but the overall trajectory points to a little bit more stimulus.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Trump&#8217;s tariffs</h4>

<p>Despite Germany&#8217;s outperformance in 2024 and the potential new post-election stimulus, analysts have raised concerns about the impact of possible U.S. tariffs on Berlin.</p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump has already threatened such measures on European economies, which could expose Germany&#8217;s auto sector to further pain.</p>

<p>Trump&#8217;s announcements are the &#8220;key item to watch,&#8221; Reeh said when asked about whether the German market&#8217;s outperformance will continue in the new year.</p>

<p><strong>Fed might force hand of global banks <br></strong>The U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s Wednesday indication that it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/fed-rate-decision-december-2024-.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">expecting fewer rate cuts in 2025</a> than previously projected threw markets into turmoil and boosted the strength of the dollar. Global central banks insist their monetary policy is independent of the Fed, but such currency moves could <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/what-to-expect-from-global-central-banks-in-2025-after-fed-slows-cuts.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">force them to act</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Markets fall but Dow snaps losing streak<br></strong>On Thursday, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">S&amp;P 500</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">Nasdaq Composite</a> fell marginally, and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> eked out a tiny gain to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">break its losing streak</a>. Asia-Pacific markets <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/asia-markets-live-china-lpr-japan-cpi.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">dropped on Friday</a>. Australia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.AXJO&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">S&amp;P/ASX 200</a> declined 1.24% to a three-month intraday low before recovering some losses. Chinese and Japanese markets fell on the release of separate economic data from both countries&#8217; agencies.</p>

<p><strong>Interest rate and inflation updates<br></strong>The People&#8217;s Bank of China on Friday left its one- and five-year loan prime rates <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/china-pboc-keeps-benchmark-lpr-rates-steady-as-fed-signals-fewer-cuts-ahead.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">unchanged at 3.1% and 3.6%</a>, respectively. Meanwhile, Japan&#8217;s &#8220;core-core&#8221; inflation rate, which excludes fresh food and energy — and is tracked by the Bank of Japan — <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/japan-core-inflation-reading-could-prompt-bank-of-japan-hike.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">rose to 2.4% in November</a>. That figure is the highest since April.</p>

<p><strong>Partial shutdown of U.S. government?<br></strong>A House Republican bill to fund the government for three months and suspend the debt ceiling for two years <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-republicans-say-they-have-deal-to-avert-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">failed to pass</a> on Thursday night. Thirty-eight Republicans joined most Democrats to vote against the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-gop-trump-musk-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">deal</a>, which was endorsed by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Without a deal and legislation passed, a partial shutdown of the U.S. government is set to begin late Friday night.</p>

<p><strong>[PRO] A &#8216;back up the truck&#8217; moment<br></strong>The S&amp;P 500 tanked on Wednesday and continued to fall slightly on Thursday. But this is a &#8220;back up the truck&#8221; moment, said Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors&#8217; head of research. This suggests that now is, contrarily, a good time to buy stocks. These are the trends Lee&#8217;s looking at that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/tom-lee-says-back-up-the-truck-after-wednesdays-panic-selling.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">support his hypothesis</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The bottom line</h4>

<p>If we adopt an objective eye, the major U.S. benchmarks didn&#8217;t change much during Thursday&#8217;s trading session.</p>

<p>The S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.09% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.10%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.04%.</p>

<p>But when seen against the context of Wednesday&#8217;s market rout, the direction of those shifts also gives an indication, however faint, of the narrative animating the markets.</p>

<p>To rephrase the stock market on Thursday in such terms: Stocks mostly continued sliding after the Fed unleashed its projections, but the Dow finally broke its 10-day losing streak.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s kind of a mixed bag. Should investors continue treading with caution because of the downward trend? Or should they see the Dow&#8217;s breakthrough as a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel?</p>

<p>As with all things in the markets, there aren&#8217;t any clear answers. The only thing that&#8217;s more certain is that data points, such as today&#8217;s U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index for November, will sway the markets more forcefully than before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever the reaction is going to be, it&#8217;s probably going to be more severe one way or the other than it would have been prior to seeing the Fed really increase those expectations,&#8221; said Mike Dickson, head of research and quantitative strategies at Horizon Investments, referring to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/investors-need-to-adjust-rate-outlook-but-shouldnt-panic-datatreks-colas-says.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">Fed&#8217;s projection</a> that PCE will come in higher than the central bank&#8217;s 2% target.</p>

<p>Indeed, Wall Street&#8217;s fear gauge spiked 74% to 27.62 on Wednesday, its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/wall-streets-fear-gauge-the-vix-saw-second-biggest-spike-ever-on-wednesday.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078627">second-biggest jump in its history</a>. And even though the VIX cooled off by 12.8% on Thursday, it still closed above 20 — a sign of elevated levels of fear in the market.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s somewhat ironic, but volatility might be the only thing that&#8217;s more certain now.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<ul> <li>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he told the European Union it must reduce its trade gap with the U.S. through oil and gas purchases or face tariffs.</li> <li>Enrico Letta, former prime minister of Italy, told CNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Squawk Box Europe&#8221; on Friday that the EU needed to be prepared to retaliate to Trump&#8217;s threat.</li> <li>Donald Trump made threats of sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners a key part of his presidential campaign.</li></ul>

<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday said he told the European Union it must reduce its trade gap with the U.S. through oil and gas purchases or face tariffs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas. Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way,&#8221; Trump posted on his Truth Social platform shortly after 1 a.m. ET.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/europe/european-union">U.S. figures</a>, the country&#8217;s goods and services trade deficit with the European Union was $131.3 billion in 2022.</p>

<p>&#8220;The EU and U.S. have deeply integrated economies, with overall balanced trade and investment. We are ready to discuss with President-elect Trump how we can further strengthen an already strong relationship, including by discussing our common interests in the energy sector,&#8221; European Commission Spokesperson Olof Gill told CNBC in response to Trump&#8217;s comments.</p>

<p>&#8220;The EU is committed to phasing out energy imports from Russia and diversifying our sources of supply,&#8221; Gill added.</p>

<p>A senior EU diplomat, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the topic, told CNBC that they were not surprised by Trump&#8217;s comment Friday and that energy was a &#8220;good option&#8221; for buying more U.S. goods.</p>

<p>Another EU official, who also did not want to be named for the same reason, told CNBC that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke with Trump last night.</p>

<p>The U.S. is the biggest recipient of EU goods, accounting for <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=USA-EU_-_international_trade_in_goods_statistics">nearly a fifth of the bloc&#8217;s exports</a>. The U.S.&#8217; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=USA-EU_-_international_trade_in_goods_statistics">biggest trade deficit</a> with the EU is in machinery and vehicles, with a gap totaling 102 billion euros ($106 billion) in 2023. In energy, Washington had a trade surplus with the European bloc worth 70 billion euros; it also has a <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/europe/european-union#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20has%20a,down%200.0%20percent%20from%202021.">significant trade surplus in services.</a></p>

<p>The U.S. is the world&#8217;s top oil producer and accounted for 22% of global supply in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which predicts <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=63824#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%20of,the%20current%20annual%20production%20record.">record crude oil production</a> in 2024. Producers <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/oil-markets-future-still-uncertain-under-donald-trump-after-election-win.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078631">anticipate even higher supply levels</a> in a deregulatory environment under Trump.</p>

<p>The EU had already indicated it expects to purchase more U.S. energy in the coming years. Last month, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-may-consider-replacing-russian-lng-imports-with-those-us-von-der-leyen-says-2024-11-08/">told reporters</a> that replacing Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports with U.S. volumes would be cheaper, and that the EU would look to engage and negotiate on the matter when Trump takes office in 2025.</p>

<p>European stock markets were sharply lower on Friday morning, while the euro strengthened 0.2% against the U.S. dollar to $1.038.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">EU retaliation?</h4>

<p>Trump has made threats of sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/26/trump-vows-an-additional-10percent-tariff-on-china-25percent-tariffs-on-canada-and-mexico.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078631">including China, Mexico and Canada</a> a signature part of his presidential campaign — and he&#8217;s continued the narrative as he prepares to enter office, despite <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/17/trump-trade-peter-navarro-tariffs-inflation-deficit-.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078631">economists warning</a> of risks to domestic inflation.</p>

<p>Analysts say there is high uncertainty over the extent of the tariffs Trump will be willing — or able — to follow through with, and how much of his rhetoric is a starting point for striking deals.</p>

<p>His latest comment comes after EU heads of state held their final meeting of the year on Thursday, during which the topic of Europe-U.S. relations was discussed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The message is clear: the European Union is committed to continue working with the United States, pragmatically, to strengthen transatlantic ties,&#8221; European Council President António Costa said following the meeting.</p>

<p>Enrico Letta, former prime minister of Italy and dean of the IE School of Politics, Economics and Global Affairs, told CNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Squawk Box Europe&#8221; on Friday that the EU needed to be prepared to retaliate to Trump&#8217;s threat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is a transactional approach, we have to respond to this transactional approach. [Trump] mixes together energy and tariffs on goods, manufacturing and so on. I think it&#8217;s incorrect because the two topics are completely different,&#8221; Letta said.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the deal is proposed by Trump — such an asymmetric deal on topics that are not linked one to the other — I think we have to do the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Considering that the most asymmetric part is the relationship on the financial side, we have to start considering that maybe replying on the financial side could be a solution,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><em>This is CNBC&#8217;s live blog covering European markets.</em></p>

<p>European markets closed lower on Friday as investors monitored political turmoil in the U.S. and monetary policy decisions from various major economies.</p>

<p>The pan-European <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.STOXX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">Stoxx 600</a> index ended down 0.78%, with all major bourses and almost all sectors in negative territory. The index was down 1.9% on the week.</p>

<p>The United States was plunged into fresh political uncertainty <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-republicans-say-they-have-deal-to-avert-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">on Thursday evening</a>, after the failure of a Trump-backed spending bill, the passage of which would have prevented a government shutdown. Dozens of Republican lawmakers voted against the deal to fund the government for three months and suspend the U.S. debt ceiling for two years, meaning a partial government shutdown will commence on Friday night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/trump-says-european-union-must-buy-us-oil-and-gas-in-trade-ultimatum.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">issued a fresh trade threat to the EU</a>, floating on social media the possibility that he would impose new tariffs on the bloc unless it purchased more oil and gas from the United States.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">U.S. stocks</a> opened lower Friday but bounced in morning trade following a better-than-expected <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/pce-inflation-november-2024-.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">inflation print.</a></p>

<p>Elsewhere, China <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/china-pboc-keeps-benchmark-lpr-rates-steady-as-fed-signals-fewer-cuts-ahead.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">held its key interest rates steady Friday</a>, in line with expectations. The decision came after Beijing&#8217;s top officials vowed to ramp up policy-easing measures earlier this month.</p>

<p>There were also monetary policy updates from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England this week. On Wednesday, the Fed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/fed-rate-decision-december-2024-.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">announced a 25-basis-points cut</a> to its core interest rate, while the Bank of England held policy unchanged at its own Thursday meeting.</p>

<p>While the Bank of England&#8217;s decision was widely anticipated, a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/bank-of-england-holds-interest-rates-at-4point75percent-after-inflation-uptick.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">split in the vote</a> and Governor Andrew Bailey&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/04/national-insurance-rise-biggest-issue-after-budget-says-bank-of-england-governor-andrew-bailey">comments</a> about the economic impact of the newly elected Labour government&#8217;s budget rattled markets, sparking a dip in the value of the British pound and yields on Britain&#8217;s 10-year Gilts to tick higher.</p>

<p>In Russia, meanwhile, the central bank unexpectedly left its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/russian-central-bank-surprises-markets-by-holding-key-rate-at-21percent.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">key interest rates unchanged</a> at 21%, citing improved monetary tightness that had created the conditions to tame sky-high inflation.</p>

<p><em>— CNBC&#8217;s Christina Wilkie, Sonia Heng and Anniek Bao contributed to this European markets summary.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">European markets close lower</h2>

<p>European markets closed lower Friday as investors digested a week full of monetary policy decisions from various major economies.</p>

<p>The regional <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.STOXX/">Stoxx 600</a> index provisionally ended down 0.78%, with all major bourses and the majority of sectors in the red.</p>

<p>The U.K.&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FTSE/">FTSE 100</a> closed down 0.16%, France&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FCHI/">CAC 40</a> was off 0.09%, Germany&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.GDAXI/">DAX</a> ended 0.27% lower and Italy&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FTMIB/">FTSE MIB</a> finished down 0.05%.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> bounced in morning deals as U.S. stocks climbed higher on better than expected inflation data. The Dow rose 0.9% to recover some of this week&#8217;s losses and the S&amp;P added 0.8%.</p>

<p>The personal consumption expenditures price index <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/pce-inflation-november-2024-.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">rose 2.4%</a> year-over-year in November, fresh data showed Friday. That was less than economists had expected, helping to alleviate some of the concern that arose earlier this week when the Fed it would move cautiously on future rate cuts.</p>

<p><em>— Karen Gilchrist</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">U.S. stocks open lower</h2>

<p>U.S. stocks opened lower Friday in the final session of a tough week that saw the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> record its worst losing streak since the 1970s.</p>

<p>The Dow was down 0.08% in opening trade, while the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">S&amp;P 500</a> was 0.39% lower. The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NDAQ&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">Nasdaq</a>, meanwhile, shed 0.94%.</p>

<p>In an overwhelmingly gloomy trading session for European stocks, German carmaker Volkswagen&#8217;s shares bucked the trend to gain more than 2% by 1:30 p.m. London time.</p>

<p>The stock&#8217;s rise followed reports that Volkswagen was making progress in ongoing negotiations with its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/02/strikes-at-volkswagen-plants-across-germany-as-wage-conflict-escalates.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">striking workers in Germany</a>. People familiar with the matter told CNBC that talks were heading in the right direction, but no deal had been reached.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bitcoin falls 8%</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BTC.CM=&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">Bitcoin</a> dipped below the $93,000 mark earlier on Friday before ticking higher again in volatile trade.</p>

<p>By around 8:26 ET, bitcoin was trading at $93,809.39, according to Coin Metrics, down around 8% from 24 hours before when it was priced above $102,000.</p>

<p>The move comes after the cryptocurrency topped the $100,000 threshold earlier this month to much fanfare. It hit a record high of more than $108,000 earlier this week.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Novo Nordisk stock nosedives</h2>

<p>Novo Nordisk stock plummeted on Friday, after results from a trial of its CagriSema weight loss drug missed expectations, according to Reuters.</p>

<p>Shares of the Danish pharmaceutical giant, which manufactures weight loss drug Wegovy, were on course for their worst-ever daily loss, shedding more than 18% by 11:33 a.m. London time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Russia keeps key interest rate at 21%</h2>

<p>Russia&#8217;s central bank on Friday held its key interest rate steady at 21%, with policymakers saying in a <a href="https://www.cbr.ru/eng/press/pr/?file=20122024_133000key_eng.htm">statement</a> that monetary conditions had &#8220;tightened more significantly than envisaged by the October key rate decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>The central bank forecast that inflation in Russia would drop to 4% by 2026. Annual inflation in the country stood at 8.9% in November, rising from 8.5% a month earlier. Sanctions in the wake of Russia&#8217;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and a weaker ruble, have helped keep prices elevated.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RUBUSD=&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">Russian ruble</a> was trading around 0.7% lower against the U.S. dollar by 10:37 a.m. London time, at 102.80 per dollar.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">British assets rocky</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GBP=&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">British pound</a> has had a volatile few days after data showed the U.K. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/13/uk-october-2024-gdp-uk-economy-shrinks-by-0point1percent-in-october.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">economy contracted</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/uk-inflation-november-2024.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">inflation rose</a>, while the Bank of England <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/bank-of-england-holds-interest-rates-at-4point75percent-after-inflation-uptick.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">kept interest rates steady</a>. Sterling was little changed against the dollar on Friday morning, after sustaining losses against the greenback on both Wednesday and Thursday. The British currency was trading at $1.2503 at 9:55 a.m. London time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, yields on Britain&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UK10Y-GB&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078629">10-year Gilt</a> picked up to a fresh 52-week high on Friday, edging upward to 4.587%.</p>

<p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical firm Zealand Pharma tumbled to the bottom of the Stoxx 600 index on Friday morning, with the stock sliding 10% by 8:45 a.m. London time.</p>

<p>It came after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to approve glepaglutide, a drug manufactured by the firm, for use in the treatment of bowel disease. On Thursday, Zealand Pharma <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/19/3000220/0/en/U-S-Food-and-Drug-Administration-issues-Complete-Response-Letter-for-the-glepaglutide-New-Drug-Application-for-the-treatment-of-short-bowel-syndrome.html">said</a> it would continue talks with the FDA to try to obtain regulatory approval for the drug.</p>

<p>Retail sales volumes in Britain rose by an estimated 0.5% in the year to November, according to the U.K.&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/bulletins/retailsales/november2024">Office for National Statistics</a>.</p>

<p>In figures published on Friday, the ONS said sales growth among grocery retailers and other non-food stores were offset by a decline in clothing sales. The figures, which covered the four-week period ending Nov. 23, did not include data on this year&#8217;s Black Friday sales.</p>

<p>On a monthly basis, sales volumes were up 0.2%, following a month-on-month fall of 0.7% in October.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.cnbc.com/p/gZWlPC/cnbc_global?playertype=synd&amp;autoplay=true&amp;byGuid=7000361232" frameborder="0" class="cnbcplayer" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Investors should look to the unloved region of Europe for opportunities, according to fund manager Sean Peche, who said there are some &#8220;very attractively priced&#8221; companies in the region.</p>

<p>Europe has fallen out of favor, Ranmore Fund Management&#8217;s Peche told CNBC&#8217;s Silvia Amaro — and investors have been distracted by Donald Trump&#8217;s U.S. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/trump-wins-2024-election-for-president.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077455">election win.</a></p>

<p>&#8220;At the same time as Europe&#8217;s been struggling you&#8217;ve had this Trump euphoria,&#8221; Peche said. &#8220;So everyone&#8217;s been rushing to invest in the U.S. &#8230; But running off to the latest, shiniest thing is not normally a good way to make money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peche shrugged off investor concerns over France, which — <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/16/german-chancellor-olaf-scholz-loses-confidence-vote.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077455">along with Germany</a> — has been in the throes of political turmoil in recent weeks. French President Emmanuel <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/13/emmanuel-macron-names-francois-bayrou-as-frances-new-prime-minister.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077455">Macron named Francois Bayrou his new prime minister</a> last week following the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/french-government-toppled-in-no-confidence-vote-brought-by-opposition.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077455">toppling of Michel Barnier&#8217;s government</a>.</p>

<p>Macron called a snap election in June which delivered a result with no clear majority, sparking months of political chaos and gridlock.</p>

<p>But Peche remains unfazed. &#8220;Maybe the euro falls apart, it probably doesn&#8217;t. And the companies that we own are very attractively priced,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>These stocks include French bank <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BNP-FR&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077455">BNP Paribas</a> — which he noted has grown book value (or net worth) consistently — and Dutch investment bank <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077455">ABN Amro</a>, which has a 10.2% dividend yield. &#8220;That&#8217;s very attractive,&#8221; Peche said.</p>

<p>Looking to the U.K., the fund manager said that &#8220;attractive&#8221; stocks such as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ABF-GB&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077455">Associated British Foods</a>, which owns retail giant Primark, were also being ignored by investors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Primark is doing really well. It&#8217;s a nice, diversified business with [a] great management team. I&#8217;m not going to wake up tomorrow and find that the management team has done something stupid,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re attractively priced. We&#8217;re getting a nice dividend. They&#8217;re buying back shares, but it&#8217;s out of favor because it&#8217;s a mid-cap and it&#8217;s listed in the U.K.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Eyes on the toymaker</h4>

<p>Peche is bullish on mid-cap firms on the other side of the Atlantic, such as U.S. toy giant <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MAT&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077455">Mattel</a>.</p>

<p>With household brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels under its umbrella, the toymaker has diversified beyond its core products.</p>

<p>Mattel&#8217;s management team has &#8220;turned the business around such that debt is now very manageable, and they&#8217;ve launched <a href="https://investors.mattel.com/news/news-details/2024/Mattel-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Financial-Results/default.aspx">a $1 billion buyback</a>,&#8221; Peche said.</p>

<p>The release of a new animated Barbie Netflix series in November and a second documentary series in September charting Mattel&#8217;s rise gives the toymaker — currently valued around $6.2 billion — &#8220;growth potential,&#8221; Peche said.</p>

<p>Mattel saw a sharp rise in Barbie toy purchases after the resounding <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/25/mattel-mat-q3-earnings-barbie-sales-surge.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077455">success of the &#8220;Barbie&#8221; movie</a> in 2023, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/24/barbie-is-highest-grossing-domestic-film-release-in-2023.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077455">highest-grossing</a> film of that year earning more than $1.4 billion worldwide. It has also produced toys for hit films such as &#8220;Moana&#8221; and &#8220;Wicked,&#8221; although <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/11/mattel-wicked-dolls-adult-website-on-packaging.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077455">the latter hit a snag</a> and it was forced to pull its line of character dolls after a package misprint linked to a pornographic website.</p>

<p>In October, both Mattel and competitor <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HAS/">Hasbro</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/24/mattel-hasbro-lower-guidance-ahead-of-holiday-season.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108077455">lowered their end-of-year guidance</a> as toy sales slid during the third quarter. Mattel said it expects sales for the last three months of the year to be &#8220;comparable to slightly down&#8221; from its prior guidance update.</p>

<ul> <li>President-elect Donald Trump this week transferred his entire stake of shares in Trump Media to a revocable trust of which he is the sole beneficiary, regulatory filings revealed.</li> <li>Trump did not receive any money for the gift of the 114,750,000 shares to the Donald J.

<p>President-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong> this week transferred his entire stake of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/13/trump-media-djt-not-selling-stock-pops.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078604">shares</a> in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DJT&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078604">Trump Media</a> to a revocable trust of which he is the sole beneficiary, regulatory <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001474506-24-000291.htm">filings</a> revealed Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Trump did not receive any money for the gift of his 114,750,000 shares of Trump Media <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/08/trump-media-how-much-truth-social-app-executives-make.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078604">stock</a> to the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust on Tuesday, according to a filing with the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.</p>

<p>Because Trump is the beneficiary of the trust, he now &#8220;indirectly&#8221; owns the Trump Media shares he transferred, the SEC filing noted.</p>

<p>The president-elect&#8217;s son, Donald Trump Jr., is the sole trustee of the trust, and has sole voting and investment power over securities held by the entity, according to a separate SEC filing Thursday.</p>

<p>Trump Media, which trades under the DJT ticker, closed at $35.41 per share Thursday, making the value of the transferred stock more than $4 billion.</p>

<p>Trump, who is set to be sworn in as president for a second non-consecutive term on Jan. 20, had been the largest individual shareholder in the social media company, which operates the Truth Social app. His stake represented nearly 53% of the company&#8217;s outstanding shares.</p>

<p>The company has a market capitalization of more than $7 billion, a figure that dwarfs the firm&#8217;s meager sales.</p>

<p>Trump Media on Nov. 5 — Election Day — reported quarterly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/05/trump-media-loses-19point2-million-in-third-quarter-surprise-election-day-filing-reveals.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078604">revenue</a> of just $1.01 million, and a net loss of $19.2 million. The company also reported that it ended the third quarter with $673 million in cash and investments, with no debt.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/108075064-1734014118873-AP24347524436628.jpg?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="President-elect Donald Trump arrives to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Thursday, Dec. 12, 2024, in New York." data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite>Alex Brandon | AP</cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-text="President-elect Donald Trump arrives to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Thursday, Dec. 12, 2024, in New York." data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text">President-elect Donald Trump arrives to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Thursday, Dec. 12, 2024, in New York.</span></span></div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the share transfer.</p>

<p>A Trump Media spokeswoman did not comment on the transaction beyond pointing to the two SEC filings that detailed the move and the role played by Trump&#8217;s son in the trust.</p>

<p>The SEC filing on Thursday said that after Trump transferred his shares, he &#8220;directly owned 0 shares of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp. and indirectly owned 114,750,000 shares of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The reporting person [Trump] is the settlor and sole beneficiary of the Trust,&#8221; the filing said.</p>

<p>The type of transfer Trump used this week is not new for the president-elect, although the dollar value of his shares outpaces the value of any assets he previously moved.</p>

<p>Before his first inauguration as president in 2017, Trump made similar transfers to the same revocable trust.</p>

<p>At that time, Trump transferred various real estate holdings, assets and liabilities to the trust, according to reports produced by <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2023-10/px-00773-june-30-2018-statement-of-financial-condition.pdf">Mazars</a>, which then was his accounting firm.</p>

<p>He also made transfers to the trust in February 2016, when he was campaigning for president.</p>

<p>Trump has not held an executive position in Trump Media, whose shares began public trading earlier this year after the then-privately held company merged with a public company, Digital World Acquisition Corp.</p>

<p>Trump has nominated two Trump Media&#8217;s board members to high-level positions in his administration.</p>

<p>Trump tapped former pro-wrestling mogul Linda McMahon to become secretary of Education and Kash Patel, a former Trump White House official, to become the next FBI director.</p>

<p>Trump also recently named Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes to chair the President&#8217;s Intelligence Advisory Board.</p>

<p>That position does not require Senate confirmation.</p>

<p>Trump has said that Nunes, who previously represented a California district in the House of Representatives, will remain CEO of Trump Media.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<ul> <li>The &#8220;core-core&#8221; inflation rate — which strips out prices of fresh food and energy — rose to 2.4% in November from 2.3% in October, its highest level since April.</li> <li>The core inflation rate came in at 2.7%, up from the 2.3% seen in October and beating the 2.6% forecast by economists polled by Reuters.</li></ul>

<p>An inflation gauge in Japan that is closely watched by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) came in at a seven-month high in November, which could prompt the central bank to raise rates early next year.</p>

<p>The so-called &#8220;core-core&#8221; inflation rate, which strips out prices of both fresh food and energy and is tracked by the BOJ, <a href="https://www.e-stat.go.jp/en/stat-search/files?page=1&amp;layout=datalist&amp;toukei=00200573&amp;tstat=000001150147&amp;cycle=1&amp;year=20240&amp;month=24101211&amp;tclass1=000001150149&amp;result_back=1&amp;tclass2val=0">rose to 2.4% from 2.3%</a>, its highest level since April.</p>

<p>The core inflation rate — which strips out prices of fresh food — came in at 2.7%, up from the 2.3% seen in October and beating the 2.6% forecast by economists polled by Reuters.</p>

<p>Headline inflation rose to 2.9% from 2.3%, reaching its highest level since August.</p>

<p>The readings come a day after the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/bank-of-japan-holds-rates-at-0point25percent.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078567">Bank of Japan held interest rates steady at 0.25%,</a> surprising economists who expected a 25 basis points hike.</p>

<p>The BOJ said in its statement on Thursday that the decision to hold was a split 8-1 decision, with board member Naoki Tamura advocating for a 25-basis-point hike.</p>

<p>Tamura was of the view that inflation risks had become more skewed to the upside, and proposed that the bank hike interest rates during the meeting.</p>

<p>BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda reportedly said in a press conference Thursday that as underlying inflation was only increasing at &#8220;at a moderate pace,&#8221; the BOJ could go slow in raising rates,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Ueda did add, however, that the central bank was mindful that if it waited too long to raise rates, it would have to quicken rate hikes in future meetings,</p>

<p>Speaking to CNBC&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/asia-squawk-box/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078567">Squawk Box Asia</a>,&#8221; Masahiko Loo, senior fixed income strategist at State Street Global Advisors, said that the inflation print is &#8220;pretty much in line with what we think.&#8221;</p>

<p>He added that the BOJ is &#8220;super sanguine&#8221; on the country&#8217;s inflation and growth figures, but Ueda was likely focusing on foreign uncertainties, namely, the impact of the incoming Donald Trump administration.</p>

<p>The yen weakened against the U.S. dollar following the BOJ&#8217;s decision to hold rates. It hit 157.92 on Friday, marking its weakest level since July. However, the currency later strengthened again.</p>

<p>Loo explained that with the yen now &#8220;drifting&#8221; toward the 160 level against the greenback, Japan&#8217;s finance ministry might try to issue warnings to the market, or failing that, it might force a rate hike in January in a bid to support the yen.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<ul> <li>China kept its one-year and five-year LPRs unchanged at 3.1 and 3.6% respectively.</li> <li>The move, which follows a 25-basis-points rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier in the week, was expected, according to a Reuters poll of economists.</li> <li>Analysts said the Fed&#8217;s revised outlook on future rate cuts is unlikely to have a huge influence on the trajectory of policy easing by China&#8217;s central bank, although it could put pressure on the Chinese yuan.</li></ul>

<p>China kept its main benchmark lending rates unchanged on Friday, as Beijing faces the challenge of bolstering economic growth while backstopping a weakening yuan.</p>

<p>The People&#8217;s Bank of China said it would steady<strong> </strong>the one-year loan prime rate at 3.1%, with the five-year LPR at 3.6%. The 1-year LPR affects corporate and most household loans, while the 5-year LPR serves as a reference for mortgage rates. The move was expected according to a Reuters poll of 27 economists.</p>

<p>The rate decision came on the back of a widely-expected 25-basis-points <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/fed-rate-decision-december-2024-.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078013">rate cut</a> by the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/federal-reserve/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078013">U.S. Federal Reserve</a> on Wednesday. The Fed also indicated it will only reduce interest rates twice in 2025, fewer than the four cuts in its September meeting&#8217;s projection.</p>

<p>Analysts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/what-to-expect-from-global-central-banks-in-2025-after-fed-slows-cuts.html?&amp;qsearchterm=dylan%20butts">said</a> the Fed&#8217;s revised outlook on future rate cuts is unlikely to have a huge influence on the trajectory of policy easing by China&#8217;s central bank, although it could put pressure on the Chinese yuan.</p>

<p>It seems that the PBOC is not stepping in to defend the yuan, Farzin Azarm, managing director of equities trading at Mizuho Americas told CNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Street Signs Asia&#8221; on Friday.</p>

<p>&#8220;But really, what&#8217;s the point? &#8230; I think at this point, it really is a function of what rates are doing. I think it&#8217;s really a function of what the curve is doing in the U.S. And I think the central bank&#8217;s going to let it play out, to be perfectly honest with you,&#8221; said Azarm.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Chinese top officials pledged at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/12/china-stresses-plans-to-boost-growth-at-top-agenda-setting-meeting.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078013">top economic agenda-setting meetings</a> to ramp up monetary easing measures, including implementing interest rate reductions, to shore up the ailing economy.</p>

<p>The PBOC kept the one-year and five-year LPRs <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/25/chinas-central-bank-keeps-medium-term-loan-rate-unchanged-amid-yuan-weakness.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078013">unchanged</a> in November, following a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/china-lowers-benchmark-lending-rates-by-25-basis-points.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078013">widely-anticipated 25bp-cut in October</a>. The central ban<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/22/china-surprises-with-cuts-to-key-rates-to-support-weak-economy.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078013">k had surprised the markets</a> by shaving the major short and long term lending rates in July.</p>

<p>Major investment banks and research firms forecast the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/28/chinas-yuan-to-hit-record-lows-as-us-tariff-threat-mounts-investment-banks-forecast-.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078013">Chinese yuan would weaken further</a> next year, in anticipation of President-elect Donald Trump following through with his tariff threats.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.cnbc.com/p/gZWlPC/cnbc_global?playertype=synd&amp;autoplay=true&amp;byGuid=7000361504" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen class="cnbcplayer"></iframe>

<p>Despite a flurry of stimulus measures since late September, latest economic data out of China showed the country is still contending with entrenched deflation, amid tepid consumer demand and a protracted property market slump.</p>

<p>The Fed&#8217;s easing cycle going forward will create &#8220;some room for the PBOC to follow up,&#8221; Yan Wang, chief emerging markets and China strategist at Alpine Macro told CNBC&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/street-signs-asia/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078013">Street Signs Asia</a>&#8221; on Thursday, while stressing that fiscal easing will play a more critical role in driving the Chinese economy next year.</p>

<p>In a note to CNBC on Friday, Wang said he believed the PBOC should continue cutting rates to alleviate the yuan&#8217;s deflationary pressure against other currencies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, the Chinese government possesses greater fiscal flexibility and is likely to rely more on fiscal measures to stimulate growth,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p><strong>Fed might force hand of global banks <br></strong>The U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s Wednesday indication that it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/fed-rate-decision-december-2024-.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">expecting fewer rate cuts in 2025</a> than previously projected threw markets into turmoil and boosted the strength of the dollar. Global central banks insist their monetary policy is independent of the Fed, but such currency moves could <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/what-to-expect-from-global-central-banks-in-2025-after-fed-slows-cuts.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">force them to act</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Markets fall but Dow snaps losing streak<br></strong>On Thursday, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">S&amp;P 500</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">Nasdaq Composite</a> fell marginally, and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> eked out a tiny gain to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">break its losing streak</a>. The pan-European <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.STOXX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">Stoxx 600</a> slumped 1.51% in its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/european-markets-live-updates-stocks-news-boe-decision.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">worst day since Nov. 12</a>. Norway&#8217;s Norges Bank left its rate unchanged at 4.5% and Sweden&#8217;s Riksbank lowered rates by 25 basis points to 2.5%.</p>

<p><strong>Partial shutdown of U.S. government?<br></strong>A House Republican bill to fund the government for three months and suspend the debt ceiling for two years <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-republicans-say-they-have-deal-to-avert-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">failed to pass</a> on Thursday night. Thirty-eight Republicans joined most Democrats to vote against the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-gop-trump-musk-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">deal</a>, which was endorsed by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Without a deal and legislation passed, a partial shutdown of the U.S. government is set to begin late Friday night.</p>

<p><strong>Bank of England holds rates</strong><br>The Bank of England on Thursday left its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/bank-of-england-holds-interest-rates-at-4point75percent-after-inflation-uptick.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">key interest rate unchanged at 4.75%</a>, as headline inflation in November hit an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/uk-inflation-november-2024.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">eight-month high of 2.6%</a>. While that decision was in line with forecasts, the Monetary Policy Committee&#8217;s votes surprised markets. Three members of the committee voted to reduce rates, two more than a Reuters poll had predicted.</p>

<p><strong>[PRO] Trading the markets amid volatility </strong><br>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.VIX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">CBOE Volatility Index</a>, commonly known as Wall Street&#8217;s fear gauge because it measures the relative strength of 30-day price changes, jumped on Thursday after the Fed&#8217;s meeting, though it has since calmed a bit. Despite those worries, there&#8217;s opportunity in volatility — here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/how-to-trade-the-market-when-volatility-spikes.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">how to trade the markets</a> in such times.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The bottom line</h4>

<p>If we adopt an objective eye, the major U.S. benchmarks didn&#8217;t change much during Thursday&#8217;s trading session.</p>

<p>The S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.09% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.10%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.04%.</p>

<p>But when seen against the context of Wednesday&#8217;s market rout, the direction of those shifts also gives an indication, however faint, of the narrative animating the markets.</p>

<p>To rephrase the stock market on Thursday in such terms: Stocks mostly continued sliding after the Fed unleashed its projections, but the Dow finally broke its 10-day losing streak.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s kind of a mixed bag. Should investors continue treading with caution because of the downward trend? Or should they see the Dow&#8217;s breakthrough as a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel?</p>

<p>As with all things in the markets, there aren&#8217;t any clear answers. The only thing that&#8217;s more certain is that data points, such as today&#8217;s U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index for November, will sway the markets more forcefully than before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever the reaction is going to be, it&#8217;s probably going to be more severe one way or the other than it would have been prior to seeing the Fed really increase those expectations,&#8221; said Mike Dickson, head of research and quantitative strategies at Horizon Investments, referring to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/investors-need-to-adjust-rate-outlook-but-shouldnt-panic-datatreks-colas-says.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">Fed&#8217;s projection</a> that PCE will come in higher than its 2% target.</p>

<p>Indeed, Wall Street&#8217;s fear gauge spiked 74% to 27.62 on Wednesday, its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/wall-streets-fear-gauge-the-vix-saw-second-biggest-spike-ever-on-wednesday.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078587">second-biggest jump in its history</a>. And even though the VIX cooled off by 12.8% on Thursday, it still closed above 20 — a sign of elevated levels of fear in the market.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s somewhat ironic, but volatility might be the only thing that&#8217;s more certain now.</p>

<ul> <li>FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam said his company can do well even if there is a supply chain shakeup.</li> <li>President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to drastically hike import tariffs for several countries, especially China, and these moves would likely disrupt global supply chains.</li> <li>FedEx reported a mixed quarter Thursday after close and announced it plans to spin off its freight business into another publicly traded company, FedEx Freight.</li></ul>

<p>In a Thursday interview with CNBC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/jim-cramer-bio/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078426">Jim Cramer</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FDX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078426">FedEx</a> CEO Raj Subramaniam said his company can do well even if there is a supply chain shakeup.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the supply chain patterns change, we are here, there and everywhere,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the advantage people sometimes miss, the fact that we have a scaled network in place, provides us an advantage in these dynamic times<strong>.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to drastically hike import tariffs for several countries, especially China, and these moves would likely disrupt global supply chains. While Subramaniam conceded that China currently represents roughly 28% to 30% of global manufacturing, he said the good news for FedEx is that its network is global, claiming the company serves 99% of global commerce.</p>

<p>This dynamic makes it easier for FedEx to &#8220;adapt and move our capacity around&#8221; and connect any point in the network to the rest of the world, he continued. Subramaniam also said the company is seeing better-than-expected demand this month. He said he thinks consumers are feeling more bullish and suggested December could be a record month for the Los Angeles port.</p>

<p>FedEx reported a mixed quarter Thursday after close and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241219594478/en/FedEx-Announces-Intent-to-Separate-FedEx-Freight-Creating-Two-Industry-Leading-Public-Companies">announced</a> it plans to spin off its freight business into another publicly traded company, FedEx Freight. Shares climbed more than 8% in extended trading. Subramaniam said the split could help create long-term value for shareholders of both companies.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are sitting on global supply chain insights,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So not only do we want to be a leading transportation network provider, but also a global supply chain technology provider.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p><em>This is CNBC&#8217;s live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.</em></p>

<p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell on Friday as investors digest inflation data out of Japan, as well as an interest rate decision out of China.</p>

<p>The People&#8217;s Bank of China <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/china-pboc-keeps-benchmark-lpr-rates-steady-as-fed-signals-fewer-cuts-ahead.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">held its loan prime rates steady</a> on Friday, leaving the one-year rate unchanged at 3.1% and the five-year rate at 3.6%.</p>

<p>The one-year LPR influences corporate loans and most household loans in China, while the five-year LPR serves as a benchmark for mortgage rates.</p>

<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.HSI/">Hang Seng index</a> was flat in its final hour of trade, while mainland China&#8217;s CSI 300 dropped 0.45% to close at 3,927.74.</p>

<p>Japan also released its November inflation numbers, a day after the Bank of Japan <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/bank-of-japan-holds-rates-at-0point25percent.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">held rates at 0.25%</a>.</p>

<p>The core inflation rate in the country — which strips out prices of fresh food — <a href="https://www.e-stat.go.jp/en/stat-search/files?page=1&amp;layout=datalist&amp;toukei=00200573&amp;tstat=000001150147&amp;cycle=1&amp;year=20240&amp;month=24101211&amp;tclass1=000001150149&amp;result_back=1&amp;tclass2val=0">came in at 2.7%</a>, slightly higher than the 2.6% expected from economists polled by Reuters</p>

<p>Headline inflation came in at 2.9%, higher than the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/22/japan-october-inflation-rate-falls-boj-rate-hike-still-on-table.html#:~:text=A%20market%20in%20Tokyo%20in%20June%202023.&amp;text=Afp%20%7C%20Getty%20Images-,Japan's%20headline%20inflation%20rate%20slipped%20to%202.3%25%20in%20October%2C%20its,%2C%20down%20from%20September's%202.4%25.">2.3% seen in October</a>.</p>

<p>Japan&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.N225&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">Nikkei 225</a> fell 0.29% after the inflation reading and closed at 38,701.9, while the broad-based Topix slipped 0.44% and finished at 2,701.99.</p>

<p>South Korea&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.KS11&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">Kospi</a> was down 1.3% to end at 2,404.15, and the small cap Kosdaq lost 2.35% to 668.31, leading Asian losses.</p>

<p>Australia&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.AXJO&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">S&amp;P/ASX 200</a> fell 1.24% to close at 8,067, its lowest closing level since September.</p>

<p>Overnight in the U.S., the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> narrowly snapped its longest losing streak since 1974 on Thursday.</p>

<p>The 30-stock Dow added 0.04%, but other major U.S. indexes fell, with the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/">S&amp;P 500</a> down 0.09% and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/">Nasdaq Composite</a> falling 0.10%.</p>

<p>The 10-year Treasury yield also rose for a second day, topping 4.5% and pressuring stocks. The benchmark yield surged more than 13 points in the previous session.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Yen reverses weakness after top Japanese officials reportedly say currency moves are &#8216;alarming&#8217;</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPY=&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">yen</a> reversed losses against the U.S. dollar after top Japanese finance officials <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/japans-government-alarmed-by-recent-forex-moves-top-officials-say-2024-12-20/#:~:text=%22We%20have%20been%20recently%20seeing,excessive%20moves%2C%22%20he%20said.">reportedly said</a> that recent moves in the Japanese currency were &#8220;alarming.&#8221;</p>

<p>The currency weakened sharply on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled fewer rate cuts in 2025 and the Bank of Japan held rates at its most recent policy meeting.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato told a regular news conference on Friday he has been seeing &#8220;one-sided and sharp moves,&#8221; adding that he was &#8220;alarmed by recent currency market developments.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuters added that Japan&#8217;s top currency diplomat Atsushi Mimura also said he had been alarmed by currency moves and flagged a readiness to take appropriate action.</p>

<p>Other notable moves in Asian currencies include the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KRW=&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">South Korean won</a>, which weakened 0.4% and approached a 15-year low, while the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/INR=&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">Indian rupee</a> edged up from a record plunge against the greenback.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">China keeps benchmark lending rates steady as Fed signals fewer cuts ahead</h2>

<p>China kept its main benchmark lending rates unchanged on Friday, as Beijing faces the challenge of bolstering economic growth while backstopping a weakening yuan.</p>

<p>The People&#8217;s Bank of China said it would keep<strong> </strong>the one-year loan prime rate at 3.1%, with the five-year LPR holding steady at 3.6%. The 1-year LPR affects corporate and most household loans, while the 5-year LPR serves as a reference for mortgage rates. The move was expected according to a Reuters poll of 27 economists.</p>

<p>The rate decision came on the back of a widely-expected 25-basis-points <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/fed-rate-decision-december-2024-.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">rate cut</a> by the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/federal-reserve/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">U.S. Federal Reserve</a> on Wednesday. The Fed also indicated it will only reduce interest rates twice in 2025, fewer than the four cuts in its September meeting&#8217;s projection.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Japan&#8217;s core inflation comes in above expectations, &#8220;core-core&#8221; gauge hits seven-month high</h2>

<p>An inflation gauge in Japan that is closely watched by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) came in at a seven-month high in November, which could prompt the central bank to raise rates early next year.</p>

<p>The so-called &#8220;core-core&#8221; inflation rate, which strips out prices of both fresh food and energy and is tracked by the BOJ, <a href="https://www.e-stat.go.jp/en/stat-search/files?page=1&amp;layout=datalist&amp;toukei=00200573&amp;tstat=000001150147&amp;cycle=1&amp;year=20240&amp;month=24101211&amp;tclass1=000001150149&amp;result_back=1&amp;tclass2val=0">rose to 2.4% from 2.3%</a>, its highest level since April.</p>

<p>The core inflation rate — which strips out prices of fresh food — came in at 2.7%, up from the 2.3% seen in October and beating the 2.6% forecast by economists polled by Reuters.</p>

<p>Headline inflation rose to 2.9% from 2.3%, reaching its highest level since August.</p>

<p>The November figure was also higher than the revised figure of 1% recorded in October.</p>

<p>On a month-on-month basis, producer prices climbed 0.1%, the first rise since July and a reversal from the 0.1% fall in October.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">House Republicans say they’ve reached a deal to head off government shutdown</h2>

<p>Key House Republicans said on Thursday afternoon that they reached a short-term government funding deal to prevent a government shutdown that would have started on Friday evening.</p>

<p>The accord comes after President-elect Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-gop-trump-musk-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">indicated</a> he would not support a measure that doesn&#8217;t include a debt ceiling increase.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wall Street’s fear gauge — the VIX — saw second-biggest spike ever on Wednesday</h2>

<p>Wall Street&#8217;s fear gauge — the VIX — spiked by the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/wall-streets-fear-gauge-the-vix-saw-second-biggest-spike-ever-on-wednesday.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">second biggest percentage in its history</a> on Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve jolted the stock market by saying it would dial back its rate-cutting campaign.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.VIX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078552">CBOE Volatility Index</a> surged 74% to close at 27.62, up from around 15 earlier in the day. That surge is the second-greatest in history, behind a 115% leap to above the 37 handle back in February 2018 when there was a blow-up in funds tracking the volatility index.</p>

<p>Wednesday&#8217;s move comes after the central bank said it will likely lower interest rates just twice next year, down from the four cuts it projected back in September, alarming investors who wanted low rates to keep fueling the bull market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled by 1,100 points to its 10th straight loss.</p>

<ul> <li>CNBC&#8217;s Jim Cramer reviewed recent market action, saying some of the downturn over the past several sessions was due to faulty predictions.</li> <li>&#8220;Companies, and even the Fed, should not make predictions unless they know that the predictions are well within reach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No one ever held it against you for being too conservative with your guidance.&#8221;</li> <li>Cramer said an overzealous prediction hurt Micron, as the semiconductor outfit was optimistic the PC business would be strong.</li></ul>

<p>CNBC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/jim-cramer-bio/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078425">Jim Cramer</a> on Thursday reviewed recent market action, saying some of the downturn over the past several sessions was due to faulty predictions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Companies, and even the Fed, should not make predictions unless they know that the predictions are well within reach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No one ever held it against you for being too conservative with your guidance. And if you don&#8217;t have enough visibility to make a good prediction, just stay mum.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Cramer, unmet expectations and aggressive guidance drove some of the recent sell-off. The averages have tanked as of late, and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078425">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> posted its first <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/17/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078425">10-day losing streak</a> since 1974 on Wednesday. But the 30-stock Dow slinked towards recovery on Thursday, finishing up 0.04%, while the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078425">S&amp;P 500</a> slid 0.09% and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078425">Nasdaq Composite</a> dipped 0.10%.</p>

<p>Investors were disappointed by commentary from the Federal Reserve after it cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, Cramer said. The cut was widely expected, but Wall Street balked when the central bank indicated it intended to make two cuts next year, instead of the four cuts it teased a few months ago. Cramer said the Fed should have been more cautious about the third cut, and it should have better maintained its staunch data-driven approach to decisions. Cramer suggested that recent economic <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/inflation-cpi-bls-november-2024-in-one-chart.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078425">data</a> didn&#8217;t justify the cut and said Fed Chair Jerome Powell was &#8220;trapped by his own prediction.&#8221;</p>

<p>An overzealous prediction also hurt <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MU&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078425">Micron</a>, Cramer added, saying the semiconductor outfit was optimistic the PC business would be strong. But during Wednesday night&#8217;s earnings call, Micron said the PC refresh cycle is &#8220;unfolding more gradually.&#8221; The company described inventory challenges and issued <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/micron-shares-plunge-on-weak-second-quarter-guidance.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078425">weaker-than-expected</a> guidance. Shares plunged Thursday, down more than 16% by close, but Cramer suggested the loss might not have been as severe had expectations been lower.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the world of Wall Street, if you make a prediction, you better beat it, or else your stock&#8217;s going to get clobbered,&#8221; he said.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> bounced on Friday to close out a tough week that saw the index plunge 1,100 points in a single day and complete its longest losing streak since the 1970s. Some cooler-than-expected inflation data helped fuel Friday&#8217;s bounce.</p>

<p>The 30-stock Dow gained 614 points, or 1.4%. The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">S&amp;P 500</a> added 1.3%, alongside the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Nasdaq Composite</a>.</p>

<p>November&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/pce-inflation-november-2024-.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">reading</a> of the personal consumption expenditures price index – the Federal Reserve&#8217;s preferred inflation metric &#8211; increased 2.4% year-over-year. That was a tad less than economists expected and helped defuse some of the bearishness that arose earlier this week when the Fed said it would dial back future rate cuts in part because of stubborn inflation.</p>

<p>Stocks that were taking losses earlier in the session such as Nvidia and Tesla led the Friday comeback. Tesla was last higher by about 1%. Nvidia gained 2%.</p>

<p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/steve-liesman/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Steve Liesman</a> he was encouraged by Friday&#8217;s inflation figures and that rates could still decline next year despite the central bank&#8217;s cautious stance.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still on path to get to 2% and at least for this new month you don&#8217;t want to make too much out of any one month, but I&#8217;m hopeful that this suggests that the couple of months of firming were more of a bump than a change in path,&#8221; Goolsbee said. Major indexes jumped intraday following Goolsbee&#8217;s comments.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a positive end to a tumultuous week. During Thursday&#8217;s trading session, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Dow</a> eked out a 15-point gain and ended a 10-day losing streak — its longest since 1974. The small gain came a day after the Dow plunged 1,100 points on Wednesday. The Fed&#8217;s indicating just two cuts next year, instead of the four it originally forecast, was the catalyst for the decline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Today has calmed people down,&#8221; said Tom Fitzpatrick, managing director at R.J. O&#8217;Brien and Associates. &#8220;[It&#8217;s] unlikely we get a downside catalyst now ahead of Christmas and New Year&#8217;s, so [the] moves of the last few days can get unwound a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Weighing on sentiment still a bit Friday was the failure Thursday night of a Trump-endorsed House Republican measure to fund the government for three months and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-republicans-say-they-have-deal-to-avert-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">avert a government shutdown</a>. Without a deal, a partial shutdown is slated to start Friday night.</p>

<p>After Friday&#8217;s jump, the Dow was on pace for a 2% loss for the week.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Novo Nordisk shares on pace for worst trading day since April 2002</h2>

<p>Shares of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVO&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Novo Nordisk</a> plunged more than 16% in afternoon trading, putting the stock on track for its worst day in more than 22 years.</p>

<p>If the stock closes around this level, it will see its biggest percentage decline since April 10, 2002, when it fell about 19%. Shares have also fallen more than 16% year to date and more than 18% in the past month.</p>

<p>The move lower comes after the Danish pharmaceutical giant reported <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/novo-nordisk-shares-plunge-22percent-after-cagrisema-obesity-drug-trial-results.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">disappointing late-stage trial results</a> for its experimental weight loss drug known as CagriSema.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, shares of rival obesity drug maker <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LLY&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Eli Lilly</a> moved higher on the heels of the results, rising around 2%. That stock has risen more than 32% this year.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dow headed for bullish &#8220;outside day&#8221;</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> (.DJI) is higher in midday trading Friday and on pace to form a bullish outside day if it closes above 42,787.85.</p>

<p>The blue-chip, price-weighted index turned higher in morning trading after a volatile week in which it shed more than 1,100 points Wednesday for its biggest single-day point loss since September 2022. The Dow also logged its longest losing streak since 1974.</p>

<p>On Friday, Dow constituents <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Nvidia</a> (NVDA) and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TRV&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Travelers</a> (TRV) are also exhibiting bullish outside day patterns if they close above $134.03 and $239.80, respectively.</p>

<p>A &#8220;bullish outside day&#8221; is a two-day technical trading pattern where the second day&#8217;s price range fully engulfs the prior day&#8217;s range and closes higher. Traders often view this pattern as a potential signal of a reversal in an asset&#8217;s direction.</p>

<p>Despite Friday&#8217;s rally, the Dow remains nearly 2,000 points &#8211; or about 4.4% &#8211; below its most recent all-time high from early December, highlighting the challenge of recovering from significant drawdowns.</p>

<p>&#8211;<em>Nick Wells</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Small-cap stocks bounce</h2>

<p>Small-cap stocks were winners alongside their large-cap counterparts on Friday. The small cap-focused <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.RUT&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Russell 2000</a> climbed 1.3%.</p>

<p>It comes near the end of a week of outsized losses for small caps. The Russell 2000 is tracking to finish the week down more than 4%, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s slide of 2.3% during the same period.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">More than 8 in 10 NYSE stocks are rebounding Friday in broad recovery</h2>

<p>Some 84% of New York Stock Exchange issues are trading higher Friday, only 12% are lower and the rest are unchanged after this week&#8217;s market turbulence, according to FactSet data. On the Nasdaq, 68% of all stocks are higher while just 22% are lower.</p>

<p>Measured by share volume, advancing shares account for 93% of all the volume traded on the NYSE on Friday and more than 87% on Nasdaq.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, reflecting the market&#8217;s weakness in December, new 52-week lows continue to swamp new highs on both markets, by 145 to 18 on the NYSE and 250 to 62 on Nasdaq. Trading is active, with midday composite NYSE volume some 48% of the past 30 days&#8217; average versus 61% on Nasdaq.</p>

<p>The exchange-traded fund traded about 1.3% higher on Friday. If that holds, it would snap a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/growth-stocks-join-the-sell-off-as-investors-dump-2024-winners.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">14-day negative streak</a> for the fund.</p>

<p>The ETF is on track to finish the year about 9% higher, meaning it has underperformed the broader market in 2024.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fed&#8217;s Goolsbee says inflation is still on path to ease to 2%</h2>

<p>Stocks turned higher in late morning trading after Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said Friday&#8217;s cooler-than-expected inflation reading is a positive sign that price pressures are still on track to ease to the Fed&#8217;s target.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still on path to get to 2% and at least for this new month you don&#8217;t want to make too much out of any one month, but I&#8217;m hopeful that this suggests that the couple of months of firming were more of a bump than a change in path,&#8221; Goolsbee told CNBC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/steve-liesman/?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Steve Liesman</a>.</p>

<p>The Dow jumped as much as 377 points to a session high following his comments, erasing a 195-point decline earlier during the day.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fed&#8217;s Hammack explains vote against rate cut, says inflation is &#8216;elevated&#8217;</h2>

<p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack explained her vote against this week&#8217;s interest rate cut, saying inflation remains &#8220;elevated&#8221; and the progress in bringing it down has been &#8220;uneven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Based on my estimate that monetary policy is not far from a neutral stance, I prefer to hold policy steady until we see further evidence that inflation is resuming its path to our 2 percent objective,&#8221; Hammack said in a statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;The balance of risks to the outlook appears to be skewed toward higher inflation outcomes,&#8221; she added. &#8220;A stall in inflation above 2 percent for too long would risk de-anchoring inflation expectations, making it harder to return inflation to our objective.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammack was the only member of the Federal Open Market Committee to vote against the quarter-percentage-point cut that took the central bank&#8217;s benchmark rate down to a target range between 4.25% and 4.5%.</p>

<p>Bitcoin declined more than 9% on Friday, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/20/bitcoin-falls-dropping-further-below-the-100000-mark.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">slumping below the $93,000 level</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, the digital asset touched a fresh all-time high of $108,000 and hovered around $102,000 on Thursday. The declines came after the Federal Reserve spooked financial markets when it indicated that fewer rate cuts could come next year.</p>

<p>Companies tied to cryptocurrencies fell Friday, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSTR&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">MicroStrategy</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/COIN&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Coinbase</a> last down more than 5% each. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HOOD&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Robinhood</a> shed 6%.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wall Street&#8217;s fear gauge perks up again Friday </h2>

<p>Wall Street&#8217;s fear gauge, the VIX, perked up again Friday, following its second-biggest spike in history{=null} earlier this week after the Federal Reserve said it would pare back its rate-cutting campaign.</p>

<p>The CBOE Volatility Index topped the 26 handle in the early morning, rising 9% from the previous session. It was last at 26.16.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the measure soared 74% to close at 27.62, up from around 15 earlier that same day. That increase was the second-greatest in history, following a 115% rise to above the 37 level back in February 2018 when there was a blow-up in funds tracking the volatility index.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Short sellers targeting automakers as analysts issue more sell ratings, S3 Partners says</h2>

<p>Short sellers are putting more automakers in their cross hairs in the wake of a stepped-up number of sell ratings from Wall Street analysts, according to S3 Partners, which specializes in monitoring short selling activity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Major global auto stocks have experienced significant declines in 2024, with many facing growing short positions and increased analyst sell recommendations,&#8221; S3 researchers said. &#8220;Notable patterns emerge across regions, with larger companies like Toyota, Volvo, and Porsche showing a rise in short interest and sell ratings, while smaller firms exhibit persistent short positions with minimal shifts in analyst sentiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>U.S. automakers or stocks traded here with large short positions include <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LCID&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Lucid Group</a> ($8 billion market cap), <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RIVN&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Rivian Automotive</a> ($15 billion) and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WGO&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">Winnebago Industries </a>($1.5 billion), alongside American depositary receipts of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NIO&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">NIO</a> ($9 billion).</p>

<p>&#8220;For the major stocks in each region, the short position has grown as the stock has fallen,&#8221; S3 said. &#8220;For the smaller stocks, many had large short positions to begin with.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lawmakers in Washington are scrambling to head off a last-minute government shutdown, but investors should make sure to stay in their seats, according to Wells Fargo Investment Institute.</p>

<p>President-elect Donald Trump backed a plan that House Republicans pulled together. The measure could go to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-republicans-say-they-have-deal-to-avert-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078517">a vote as early</a> as Thursday evening, and if it is approved, it could avert a shutdown that would start Friday night.</p>

<p>&#8220;We doubt there will be a new agreement in time to avert a partial shutdown after December 20, but expect a new spending bill around the end of the year,&#8221; said Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.</p>

<p>He said his team thinks there is &#8220;likely to be little economic or financial-market impact&#8221; in the event of a shutdown and that discretionary spending — not Social Security or Medicare payments — will feel the effect. He recommended maintaining current portfolio positions.</p>

<p>&#8220;We continue to foresee a strong economy heading into 2025 — we maintain our outlook for earnings growth and an S&amp;P 500 Index target range of 6500-6700,&#8221; Christopher wrote. &#8220;We are making no changes in guidance and prefer to look through any shutdown.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<ul> <li>Pro pickleball&#8217;s metrics are on the rise in its first year as a unified professional sport.</li> <li>The average pay of players on the PPA Tour and MLP was $260,000, the league said.</li> <li>The unified league, called the United Pickleball Association, has helped create efficiencies and opportunities across the business.</li></ul>

<p>Pickleball is paying off for America&#8217;s best players.</p>

<p>The Professional Pickleball Association said on Thursday that the league is seeing growth in everything from attendance to players, and even salary.</p>

<p>In fact, the average pay of the more than 60 women on the PPA Tour and Major League Pickleball was $260,000, according to the league. That is more than the <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/the-25-highest-paid-wnba-players/">highest-paid WNBA player&#8217;s annual salary</a> and more than double the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/nwsl-eliminates-draft-grants-unrestricted-free-agency-to-players.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078350">average salary of National Women&#8217;s Soccer League athletes</a>.</p>

<p>The league said pro pickleball players earned more than $30 million collectively. This is based on salary alone and does not include endorsement deals.</p>

<p>Pro pickleball has come a long way since its inception.</p>

<p>Last December, some players <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/15/pro-pickleball-players-form-collective-amid-pay-cuts-merger.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078350">formed a collective</a> to voice their concerns about the future of Major League Pickleball after they were asked to take a 40% pay cut.</p>

<p>In February, Major League Pickleball and the Professional Pickleball Association <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/major-league-pickleball-and-ppa-tour-complete-merger.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078350">completed their long-awaited merger</a>, creating the United Pickleball Association. The deal also included $75 million of outside investment.</p>

<p>The PPA Tour and Major League Pickleball retained their own distinct brands. The PPA Tour features an individual bracket-style tour, while MLP is a team-based format.</p>

<p>Since the creation of the United Pickleball Association, the off-court drama has died down and the league has been working to refine its product and its business, led by stars like 17-year-old Anna Leigh Water, and top players Federico Staksrud and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/12/pro-pickleball-player-ben-johns-i-have-multimillion-dollar-salary-now.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078350">Ben Johns.</a></p>

</figure>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just these immense efficiencies that came about as we were able to merge, and as a result, it was great for our business,&#8221; said Samin Odhwani, United Pickleball Association&#8217;s chief strategy officer.</p>

<p>Odhwani said being under one umbrella created cross-promotional opportunities for players and also opened doors with sponsors and their sales team.</p>

<p>As a result, the sponsorship business grew by 50% year-over-year with more than 50 sponsors across both the PPA Tour and MLP brands.</p>

<p>Odhwani projects that UPA revenue should top $100 million in the next few years.</p>

<p>Viewership and interest also remain strong. In 2024, the league said 320,000 fans attended PPA Tour and MLP events, up 40% from the year prior. It also marked the first year in which revenue from ticket sales surpassed revenue from amateur registration, the league said.</p>

<p>Fans tuned into 350 hours of pickleball television in 2024 across Fox, CBS, ESPN, Amazon Prime, Tennis Channel and others, according to the UPA.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/26/professional-pickleball-tennis-channel-broadcast-partnership.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078350">PickleballTV</a>, a joint venture between the UPA and the Tennis Channel, said fans watched more than a billion minutes of the sport this season.</p>

<p>&#8220;2024 was the best year ever for pro pickleball,&#8221; Odhwani said. &#8220;We had 320,000 plus attendees at our events, 27,000 amateurs playing and candidly, just a unified league.&#8221;</p>

<p>Heading into the new year, UPA said its priorities include expanding media rights partnerships, growing the amateur business and continuing to build existing pros into household names in the world of sports.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Big Lots is preparing to close all of its remaining locations after filing for bankruptcy three months ago, it announced in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/big-lots-provides-update-on-court-supervised-process-302336368.html" target="_blank">press release</a> Thursday.</p>



<p>The discount retailer will begin &#8220;going out of business&#8221; sales, or &#8220;GOB&#8221; sales, at its <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://local.biglots.com" target="_blank">963 remaining stores</a> ahead of the closures, the press release stated. It&#8217;s unclear how long the stores will remain open.</p>



<p>After filing for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/business/big-lots-bankruptcy-protection-nexus-sale/3482845/" target="_blank">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> in September and closing 400 of its locations around the country, the Columbus, Ohio-based company announced it anticipated selling its remaining assets and business operations to private equity firm Nexus Capital Management. The sale <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://biglotsinc.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/big-lots-receives-court-approval-sale-nexus" target="_blank">received court approval</a> in late October with an expected closure date of early December, but according to the press release, the company no longer expects the deal to go through.</p>



<p>Big Lots president and CEO Bruce Thorn said in the release that the company is still seeking out other sale options with the hope of completing a deal by January. The release also said the company does not anticipate that the GOB sales will inhibit any potential future asset deals.</p>



<p>&#8220;We all have worked extremely hard and have taken every step to complete a going concern sale,&#8221; Thorn said. &#8220;While we remain hopeful that we can close an alternative going concern transaction, in order to protect the value of the Big Lots estate, we have made the difficult decision to begin the GOB process.&#8221;</p>



<p>Big Lots is one of the many businesses across the country which have filed for bankruptcy in 2024, which saw a 16.2% increase in filings compared with the previous year, according to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.uscourts.gov/data-news/judiciary-news/2024/11/07/bankruptcy-filings-rise-162-percent" target="_blank">United States Courts database</a>. The retail landscape alone saw 49 bankruptcy filings, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/big-lots-initiates-going-business-sales-remaining-locations-rcna184914" target="_blank">NBC News reported</a>, up from 25 in 2023. Over 7,300 store closures have been reported this year to date, led by Family Dollar (718), CVS (586) and Big Lots (580).</p>



<p>Also on this year&#8217;s list is Red Lobster, though the popular seafood chain announced <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/business/money-report/red-lobster-cleared-to-exit-chapter-11-bankruptcy/3409799/" target="_blank">it had survived</a> its Chapter 11 proceedings in early September.</p>

<ul> <li>President-elect Donald Trump endorsed a House Republican deal for a three-month federal funding plan that would avert a government shutdown.</li> <li>Trump and Elon Musk effectively killed a prior funding proposal with their criticisms.</li> <li>The continuing resolution would suspend the U.S. debt ceiling for two years, and contains a $110 billion extension of disaster and farm aid, which had been a key demand by Democrats.</li></ul>

<iframe src="https://player.cnbc.com/p/gZWlPC/cnbc_global?playertype=synd&amp;autoplay=true&amp;byGuid=7000361596" class="cnbcplayer" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>WASHINGTON — A House <a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20241216/American%20Relief%20Act%202025.pdf">Republican bill</a> to fund the government for three months and suspend the debt ceiling for two years failed Thursday night, as dozens of rank-and-file Republicans voted against the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-gop-trump-musk-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078456">deal</a> endorsed by President-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p>

<p>Without a deal to fund the federal government and legislation that has passed the House and Senate and been signed into law, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/19/house-gop-trump-musk-government-shutdown.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078456">a partial shutdown</a> is set to begin late Friday night.</p>

<p>A total of 38 Republicans voted against the bill hammered out by their own party&#8217;s leaders. The 38 were joined by every Democrat, save for two who voted in favor and one who voted present. </p>

<p>It was unclear late Thursday what House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would do next, given how substantial the opposition to the bill was from within his own party.</p>

<p>Trump and his ally <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/elon-musk-1-million-voter-lottery-suit-sent-back-to-state-court.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078456">Elon Musk</a>, the Tesla CEO, had already doomed a prior funding proposal Wednesday by harshly criticizing its provisions, sending Republicans scrambling for most of Thursday for a replacement plan.</p>

<p>The latest failed version of the continuing resolution would have suspended the U.S. debt ceiling for two years. The ceiling is the maximum the federal government can borrow to pay for its spending.</p>

<p>That suspension was a surprising last-minute addition to the proposal, as increasing the debt ceiling typically requires months of negotiations.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/108078508-17346449682024-12-19t192957z_421108084_rc2asbavnu4g_rtrmadp_0_usa-congress-shutdown.jpeg?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries speaks to members of the news media along with U.S. House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-CA) after President-elect Donald Trump called on lawmakers to reject a stopgap bill to keep the government funded past Friday, raising the likelihood of a partial shutdown, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 19, 2024. " data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite>Leah Millis | Reuters</cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-text="U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries speaks to members of the news media along with U.S. House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-CA) after President-elect Donald Trump called on lawmakers to reject a stopgap bill to keep the government funded past Friday, raising the likelihood of a partial shutdown, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 19, 2024. " data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text">U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries speaks to members of the news media along with U.S. House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar (D-CA) after President-elect Donald Trump called on lawmakers to reject a stopgap bill to keep the government funded past Friday, raising the likelihood of a partial shutdown, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 19, 2024. </span></span></div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But Trump said Wednesday that he did not want to take office in January and immediately face a vote by Congress on the debt limit. Trump this week called for permanently abolishing the debt ceiling.</p>

<p>The new proposal also called for a $110 billion extension of disaster and farm aid, which was a key demand by House Democrats.</p>

<p>Although Democrats hold a minority of seats in the House, Republicans have a majority by only a handful of seats, making it difficult to pass significant legislation without at least a modicum of bipartisan support.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<ul> <li>As the Senate wraps up its final legislative days for the year, it is expected to vote on a bill that would increase Social Security benefits for about 3 million people.</li> <li>The Social Security Fairness Act calls for eliminating certain rules that have been in place for decades that reduce Social Security benefits for some people with public sector pensions.</li></ul>

<p>The Senate is getting closer to a <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/2024/12/18/schedule-for-thursday-december-19-2024">final vote</a> on a bill that would increase Social Security benefits for an estimated 3 million people.</p>

<p>The chamber voted Wednesday to let consideration of the bill — the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/senate-may-soon-vote-on-a-bill-to-change-certain-social-security-rules.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078357">Social Security Fairness Act</a> — proceed. The bipartisan proposal calls for repealing certain rules that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/12/some-public-workers-may-receive-reduced-social-security-benefits.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078357">reduce Social Security benefits</a> for individuals who receive pension income from work in the public sector.</p>

<p>Despite a <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00326.htm">bipartisan 73 majority</a> vote to proceed, the effort to advance the bill was met with some dissent, with Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., citing the costs associated with the change. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated repealing the rules — known as the Windfall Elimination Provision, or WEP, and Government Pension Offset, or GPO — would cost <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60690">$196 billion</a> over 10 years.</p>

<p>The WEP reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who receive pension or disability benefits from jobs where they did not pay Social Security payroll taxes. The GPO reduces Social Security benefits for spouses, widows and widowers who also receive their own government pension income.</p>

<p>Passing the bill would speed up Social Security&#8217;s trust fund insolvency dates <a href="https://www.crfb.org/press-releases/senate-will-soon-vote-speeding-social-security-insolvency">by six months</a>, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Without the change, Social Security&#8217;s trustees have projected the trust fund the program relies on to pay retirement benefits will <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum">run out in 2033</a>, when 79% of those benefits will be payable.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are about to pass an unfunded $200 billion spending package for a trust fund that is likely to go insolvent over the next nine to 10 years, and we&#8217;re going to pretend like somebody else has to fix it,&#8221; Tillis said during a Senate speech ahead of the vote to advance the bill.</p>

<p>Tillis said lawmakers are not considering the 97% of beneficiaries who would not benefit from the bill, but who would be hurt by future consequences that passing it would have on the program.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, this bill has not even had a hearing in any committee in the House or the Senate,&#8221; Tillis said.</p>

<p>The Social Security Fairness Act was approved by the House in November after two lawmakers – Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La. – <a href="https://garretgraves.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4085">filed a discharge petition</a> to force a vote on the bill. The Senate cloture vote to proceed to a final vote also limited the ability for that chamber to debate the proposal.</p>

<p>The 27 <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00326.htm">Senate leaders who voted &#8220;no&#8221;</a> on moving the Social Security Fairness Act to a final vote are all Republicans, with the exception of Sen. Joe Manchin, an independent representing West Virginia.</p>

<p>The Senators who voted to move the bill forward included a mix of Democrats and Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Vice President-elect and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;No excuse for treating our public servants this way&#8217;</h4>

<p>Leaders who spoke on the Senate floor in support of the bill ahead of Wednesday&#8217;s vote to proceed cited the financial suffering of their constituents.</p>

<p>As of November, more than 2 million people&#8217;s Social Security benefits were affected by the WEP, while more than 650,000 people were impacted by the GPO, said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who co-led the Senate version of the bill.</p>

<p>One 72-year-old constituent had to return to work after her husband died, since the GPO reduced her Social Security widow benefits by two-thirds, Collins said.</p>

<p>&#8220;She did not have the financial security any longer to remain retired, and the GPO penalty left her with few choices but to return to work,&#8221; Collins said.</p>

<p>Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., recalled meeting with a retired Louisiana schoolteacher impacted by the GPO, who cried in his office because she didn&#8217;t understand why her Social Security spousal benefits were reduced.</p>

<p>&#8220;She felt like she was being punished for educating generations of Louisiana children,&#8221; Cassidy said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no excuse for treating our public servants this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the Senate passes the bill, it will be a win for Collins and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who co-led the bill. Collins has pushed for the change for more than two decades, Brown noted in a Wednesday Senate speech. Brown is leaving the Senate after losing a reelection campaign.</p>

<p>Reps. Spanberger and Graves, who introduced the House bill, are also leaving Congress.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you love this country and fight for the people who make it work, I urge all my colleagues on both sides to join us — restore the Social Security that people who protect us in service have earned over a lifetime of work,&#8221; Brown said during a Wednesday Senate speech.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Your professional reputation will take you further in your career than your education and skills alone.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to have &#8220;status&#8221; within your workplace — in other words, decision-making influence and the respect of your co-workers — says Alison Fragale, a UNC <br>Kenan-Flagler Business School organizational psychologist and author of &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Likeable-Badass-Women-Success-Deserve/dp/0385549148">Likeable Badass: How Women Get the Success They Deserve</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fragale has spent the last 20 years researching influence and power, and says that people&#8217;s professional problems are often due, at least partially, to how they&#8217;re perceived at work.</p>

<p><em><strong>DON&#8217;T MISS: </strong></em><a href="https://cnb.cx/3waBx4l"><em><strong>The ultimate guide to earning passive income online</strong></em></a></p>

<p>&#8220;Status is what psychologists call a fundamental human need, which means all of us seek status,&#8221; says Fragale. &#8220;We all seek to be respected in different ways with different people, but when we feel like we are respected and valued by audiences that matter, that is a recipe for a more satisfying life, both physically and mentally.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here are four limiting mindsets that you should ditch to boost your status and become highly successful, according to Fragale.</p>

<p>Being yourself at work — rather than trying to be some &#8220;more professional&#8221; version of yourself — is typically seen as a good thing. But if your &#8220;I don&#8217;t care what others think of me&#8221; mindset makes you start disregarding feedback entirely, you&#8217;ll get into trouble far more easily, Fragale says.</p>

<p>Workplaces often thrive on relationship-building and collaboration between employees. If your co-workers — or, worse, your boss — think you&#8217;re disregarding feedback, they might start to think of you as arrogant or hard to work with, limiting your opportunities for professional mobility.</p>

<p>&#8220;What other people think of us matters a great defense to our quality of life,&#8221; says Fragale. The more you show that you take and implement feedback well, the more you&#8217;ll showcase your emotional intelligence and gain your colleagues&#8217; trust.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;I don&#8217;t have time for this&#8217;</h3>

<p>Simple acts can help elevate your workplace status, like scheduling a coffee chat with a colleague or helping a new employee with a task. It&#8217;s worth making time for them in your busy schedule, says Fragale.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t, you could suffer some unintended consequences, she adds: If your boss thinks your plate is too full to spare 20 minutes for a coffee chat, they might not assign you new projects that could get you considered for a raise or promotion.</p>

<p>Add reputation-building time into your schedule, Fragale advises: &#8220;Find something that I would call a daily cultivation — a daily habit or two that you can practice that would build your status. It doesn&#8217;t be something literally every day, but something that you can do with consistency.&#8221;</p>

<p>You could put time aside to brainstorm ideas for your next team meeting, or take courses or workshops to develop your skills. Fragale posts advice and information on social media five days per week to strengthen her own professional credibility, she says.</p>

<p>And when you&#8217;re genuinely really busy, try not to present yourself that way, she adds: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/16/2-ways-your-body-language-can-make-you-look-and-sound-more-confident.html?&amp;qsearchterm=confidence%20">Exuding confidence</a>, even if you&#8217;re feeling frantic, can help others perceive you in a more positive way.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;I don&#8217;t want to be a status seeker&#8217;</h3>

<p>Trying to make yourself look good at work isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad idea, says Fragale.</p>

<p>Showcasing your strengths, making your voice heard and appearing confident with your bosses and colleagues lets them know that &#8220;how I show up to you matters a great deal to me, and I&#8217;m going to think intentionally about how I can be my honest self, but do it in a way that is going to get me maximum credit in your eyes,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>You can seek status without creating a false image of yourself or trying to manipulate people&#8217;s perceptions of you, Fragale adds.</p>

<p>&#8220;The reason people are so averse to the idea of &#8216;I&#8217;m deliberately trying to manage my reputation&#8217; is, they falsely assume that means you&#8217;ve lost your authenticity in the process,&#8221; she says.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;I&#8217;m an imposter&#8217;</h3>

<p>Even your boss might experience imposter syndrome: 71% of U.S. CEOs say they have it, according to a <a href="https://www.kornferry.com/about-us/press/71percent-of-us-ceos-experience-imposter-syndrome-new-korn-ferry-research-finds">June 2024</a> Korn Ferry survey of roughly 400 executives.</p>

<p>Your own feelings of self-doubt are probably a byproduct of exploring new responsibilities and making the effort to step out of your comfort zone, Fragale says. Embracing that mindset can help you get beyond thinking &#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8217; and closer to &#8220;I&#8217;ll figure out how to do it.&#8221;</p>
