				<![CDATA[
<p>A Delaware County woman is accused of trying to fraudulently register four people – including her dead father and a person who died inside her home &#8212; to vote in the 2024 presidential election. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Jennifer Hill, 38, of Collingdale, Pennsylvania, was arrested on Thursday, Dec. 19, and charged with forgery, tampering with public record/information, applying for registration knowing individual is not entitled to registration, and other related offenses.</p>



<p>Investigators said Hill worked for <a href="https://www.newpaproject.org/">the New Pennsylvania Project</a>, a voting rights organization focused on voter registration, civic education and mobilization throughout the state. Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said Hill was a canvasser for the organization and worked on registering people to vote.</p>



<p>Through an app – provided by the Pennsylvania Department of State – Hill tried to register 310 people to vote between April 2024 and September 2024, according to investigators. Stollsteimer said 181 of those people were successfully registered while 129 were not successfully registered.</p>



<p>Stollsteimer said the state requires information – including a driver’s license and the last four digits of a social security number – during the registration process. Names that the state can’t verify are sent to the election office and then contacted through a <a href="https://www.eac.gov/about/help_america_vote_act.aspx">Help America Vote Act (HAVA)</a> letter which requests more information for verification.</p>



<p>Investigators noticed multiple names sent by Hill through the app that were variations of the same name with different addresses and emails, according to Stollsteimer. This led to an investigation in which officials determined Hill tried to fraudulently register at least four people, including her dead father, her grandmother, an unidentified person and a person who died in her home in 2011.</p>



<p>“She knows that because she was the person who called the police to come when he died in her house,” Stollsteimer said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Stollsteimer said Hill successfully registered one of the four through the state system.</p>



<p>“She did register a fraudulent person and my understanding is this is sort of a gap in the system where by putting in no date of birth and no social security number, it goes through and became a verified voter registration,” Stollsteimer said. “She did not take any further step. That fictitious person did not vote in the 2024 election. But that shows you how we still have gaps in our system that we need to have the legislature address.”</p>



<p>Hill was taken into custody and arraigned on Thursday, Dec. 19. She is being held in the Delaware County Prison after failing to post bail. Online court records don’t list legal representation who could speak on her behalf.</p>



<p>While Hill is in custody, Stollsteimer said the investigation is not over and they’re still looking into the names she tried to register.</p>



<p>“We don’t know from the other 129 that were non-verifiable, how many of those were made up names,” Stollsteimer said. “The Pennsylvania Department of State, I believe, needs to take a look at all of the ones that were submitted by this individual and frankly, I think they should look at all of the ones that were submitted by this organization. It could be just one bad canvasser, but they should take a look and make sure that all of those people are legitimate registrations.”</p>



<p>Stollsteimer also said the case highlights “gaps in our system” that the Pennsylvania legislature should address.</p>



<p>“I think the Department of State in Harrisburg needs to take a look at every single registration that she submitted to make sure that they are not fraudulent,” Stollsteimer said. “And I think our legislature needs to look at the law again and see if there are gaps that need to be filled.”</p>



<p>NBC10 reached out to the New Pennsylvania Project for comment. Kadia Kenner, CEO of the New Pennsylvania Project, confirmed Hill was a former staffer with the group. She wrote the following statement in response to the allegations. </p>



<p><strong><em>To be clear, NPPEF DOES NOT provide financial incentives or bonuses for voter registration application collection. Our employees have no quota to meet, and hourly wages paid to part-time canvassing employees remain the same no matter the number of voter registration applications collected.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Earlier this year, the Pennsylvania Department of State informed the New PA Project Education Fund (NPPEF) about potential issues regarding attempted voter registration by one of our former canvassers working in Delaware County.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Immediately upon being notified of the potential issues, we suspended the staff member pending investigation. An internal investigation was launched, and the organization paused our voter registration programs in several regions pending the outcome of our investigation.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Today’s announcement is proof that the multiple layers of internal and external quality control operate with integrity at both the New PA Project Education Fund, the Department of State, and local law enforcement. Due to the hard work of many individuals to prevent disruptive actions by bad actors, our voting rolls and elections are secure, and no fraudulent ballots were cast.</em></strong></p>



<p>In addition to Hill, Stollsteimer also announced election fraud charges against Philip Moss, an 84-year-old man accused of voting in person in Florida while also completing a mail-in ballot to vote in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>“One of the principles in our democracy is one person, one vote,” Stollsteimer said. “Mr. Moss seemed to think he was entitled to two.”</p>



<p>Stollsteimer said Moss will be taken to Delaware County where he’ll face misdemeanor charges.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The future of Philadelphia&#8217;s Market East community in Center City is now crystal clear as City Council has voted to approve a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/city-council-to-hold-final-committee-meeting-on-sixers-arena-proposal/4051357/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/city-council-to-hold-final-committee-meeting-on-sixers-arena-proposal/4051357/" target="_blank">$1.3 billion plan to bring a brand new arena for the Philadelphia Sixers</a> to the neighborhood. </p>



<p>During its scheduled meeting on Thursday, Dec. 19, 2024, City Council voted, with a majority of members in support on the legislative package that would make way for a plan that could have a transformative effect on the area. The approval occurred after months of negotiations with developers and meetings with members of the community in every corner of the city as well as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/rally-to-protest-76-place-arena-in-chinatown-brought-thousands/3963042/?os=io...&amp;ref=app%3Famp&amp;amp=1" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/rally-to-protest-76-place-arena-in-chinatown-brought-thousands/3963042/?os=io...&amp;ref=app%3Famp&amp;amp=1" target="_blank">protests</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/protesters-interrupt-philly-city-council-meeting-on-proposed-sixers-arena/4008550/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/protesters-interrupt-philly-city-council-meeting-on-proposed-sixers-arena/4008550/" target="_blank">outbursts</a> from those on both sides of the debate. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">A raucous start</h2>



<p>At the start of Thursday&#8217;s hearing, there was no shortage of protest as a group of individuals opposed to the arena plan stood arm-in-arm, chanting and blowing whistles while on the floor of City Council&#8217;s chambers in City Hall.</p>



<p>Wearing shirts that read &#8220;City Council sold out Philly&#8221; and &#8220;shut it down,&#8221; protestors sat in a group on the floor of city council as the meeting was intended to start at 10 a.m. </p>



<p>Around 10:15 a.m., several protestors were taken out of the room by law enforcement officials.</p>

<p>By About 10:25 a.m., the protestors on the floor of chambers had been removed, yet the crowd in attendance throughout the room continued to chant.</p>



<p>One of the members of an Asian civil rights group said that 40 of its members were arrested. They were held on a police bus while the meeting went on.</p>



<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t understand the full scale of impact&#8230;Chinatown getting pennies out of the deal and what happened was a couple dozen people arrested for exercising their constitutional right to protest,&#8221; said Melissa McCleery, with the Save Chinatown Coalition.</p>



<p>For some time, as City Council President Kenyatta Johnson attempted to start the meeting, chants of &#8220;shame&#8221; filled the chambers.</p>



<p>The meeting was eventually brought to order by about 10:35 a.m., though some commotion persisted. </p>



<p>In opening the meeting, Johnson addressed the crowd, calling for those in attendance to respect the process as council has had eight hearings solely dedicated to the arena plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;All we are asking is just respect our process and let us continue our business,&#8221; said Johnson at the top of the morning&#8217;s meeting. </p>



<p>Public comment &#8212; which included an &#8220;extremely long list&#8221; of speakers, according to Johnson &#8212; opened with input from those on both sides of the issue. </p>



<p>Several individuals spoke positively on the economic impact and influx of jobs the arena could provide, saying the project would benefit the city. </p>



<p>“We want to make sure that this arena is built,” Daisy Cruz of the service workers union 32BJ SEIU said. ‘Thank you for the opportunity. Thank you for building the arena.”</p>



<p>Paul Brown, who said he was a school psychologist in the city&#8217;s Roxborough community, said that council should have fought for more money for the school district in the agreement with arena developers. </p>



<p>&#8220;You are in a prime opportunity right now to demand something better, that doesn&#8217;t displace people, that doesn&#8217;t harm people, but you just want to rush through a deal that gives them less,&#8221; he said. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How did the voting go?</h2>



<p>Each of the 11 pieces of legislation needed its own vote. </p>



<p>And the majority of these bills passed with a vote of 12 to 5. </p>



<p>The councilmembers that opposed nearly every bill in this package were: Jamie Gauthier (D-3rd dist.), Rue Landau (D-At-Large), Jeffery Young (D-5th dist.), Kendra Brooks (Working Families Party, At-Large) and Nicolas V. O&#8217;Rourke (Working Families Party &#8211; At Large).</p>



<p>Yet, a few of the bills were supported by more members of council. </p>



<p>For example, one bill that would create an overlay for the Chinatown neighborhood passed 14-3. </p>



<p>Other bills up for a vote passed unanimously.</p>



<p>Following the vote, David Adelman, CEO of 76 Place, posted online to thank city officials for their support of the plan. </p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/a9xsLBJNBw">pic.twitter.com/a9xsLBJNBw</a></p>&mdash; David Adelman (@david_adelman) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_adelman/status/1869802629360169289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2024</a></blockquote> 



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What&#8217;s next? </h2>



<p>The proposal would bring an arena to the intersection of Market and Filbert streets at 10th and 11th streets. </p>



<p>Ahead of the day&#8217;s vote, City Councilmember Mark Squilla (D-1st dist.) said that, even after the day&#8217;s voting, City Council will continue to meet with stakeholders and members of the community to ensure neighbors are part of the development process. </p>



<p>“This is not the end of the process,” Squilla said. “We need to find out from the development does this legislation move the arena forward, are they looking to negotiate with other entities, go somewhere else? And I think with council we did our job up to this point and now the ball is in their court.&#8221;</p>



<p>City Council has been holding meetings since September focused solely on the arena plan. And there have been some sticking points. </p>



<p>The biggest just might be how much money the developers plan to include in a Community Benefits Agreement with the neighborhoods nearest the project site.</p>

<p>Initially, developers proposed $50 million in that agreement, but some suggested that figure be doubled.</p>



<p>In fact, some members of groups that opposed the development plan <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/groups-call-for-developers-to-raise-sixers-arena-cba-funds-to-300m-minimum/4044998/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/groups-call-for-developers-to-raise-sixers-arena-cba-funds-to-300m-minimum/4044998/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had sought to have that figure upped to $300 million</a>.</p>



<p>But, in legislation that was read before City Council for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/city-council-committee-to-vote-to-advance-sixers-arena-plan/4052513/#:~:text=NBC10's%20Aaron%20Baskerville%20has%20more,committee%20meeting%20on%20Thursday%20morning." data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/city-council-committee-to-vote-to-advance-sixers-arena-plan/4052513/#:~:text=NBC10's%20Aaron%20Baskerville%20has%20more,committee%20meeting%20on%20Thursday%20morning." target="_blank">its first reading last week</a>, the proposal was amended to request $60 million in that CBA.</p>



<p>In breaking down how this $60 million in CBA funding could be used in the community, amendments note that $33 million would be set aside for initiatives in and around the city&#8217;s Chinatown neighborhood &#8212; like developing a master plan for the community and providing $2 million in grants for small businesses. </p>



<p>The remaining $27 million would then be spread to other initiatives citywide, including $7 million for extended day/extended year schooling and $3 million for public transit at the arena.</p>



<p>With City Council&#8217;s support on Thursday, construction is expected to begin sometime in 2028.</p>



<p>Developers hope to open the arena  in 2031. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Mayor Parker reacts to City Council&#8217;s decision</h2>



<p>In addressing the approval at City Hall, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker – who <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nba/philadelphia-76ers/mayor-cherelle-parker-makes-pro-sixers-arena-case-at-community-meeting/4038647/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nba/philadelphia-76ers/mayor-cherelle-parker-makes-pro-sixers-arena-case-at-community-meeting/4038647/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long supported the arena plan</a> &#8212; applauded City Council’s decision and the work it took to get to Thursday’s vote.</p>



<p>“All of Philadelphia will benefit from this project,” she said.</p>



<p>She told councilmembers she watched as they negotiated and she valued their work.</p>



<p>“Today is not the day for high-fives and or just big parties and or celebrations,” she said. “But, it is a time to acknowledge this vitally important economic development project for the City of Philadelphia.”</p>



<p>Along with a $60 million for the community benefits agreement, Parker said that the city will get $700 million in tax revenue “for our city and school district.”</p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/cherelle-parker-celebra-voto-concejo-municipal-sixers-arena-filadelfia/2453796/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/cherelle-parker-celebra-voto-concejo-municipal-sixers-arena-filadelfia/2453796/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Léelo en español aquí</a></em></p>



<p>“It’s the largest pilot payment ever provided to the City of Philadelphia and the School District of Philadelphia,” Parker said. “And that’s something that we should be proud of.”</p>



<p>Also, Parker noted, it wasn&#8217;t lost on her that the Sixers could have moved to New Jersey if the arena plan did not come to fruition. </p>



<p>“Am I excited that our Sixers are staying home?” she asked with a grin. “Yes, I’m excited that our Sixers are staying home.”</p>



<p>And, in addressing residents of Chinatown, Parker said that city officials would “ensure that Chinatown will not only survive, it will thrive.”</p>



<p>“We will ensure that you are not harmed by this arena,” promised Parker.</p>



<p>City Council president Johnson too celebrated to move, touting the fact that the project, as proposed, would be built without any taxpayer money.</p>



<p>&#8220;If we would have turned down this particular deal, we would have been fools,&#8221; he said. </p>

<p>A third arrest was made after an argument led to a <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/police-arrest-2nd-suspect-in-shooting-that-injured-3-teens-at-dilworth-park/4057669/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/police-arrest-2nd-suspect-in-shooting-that-injured-3-teens-at-dilworth-park/4057669/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shooting that injured three teenagers near the ice rink at Dilworth Park</a> outside of Philadelphia&#8217;s City Hall last week. </p>



<p>On Thursday, Dec. 19, U.S. Marshals announced the arrest of Raheem Hylton who wanted in connection to the triple shooting that took place at Dilworth Plaza.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This evening at 8pm fugitive Raheem Hylton was apprehended by <a href="https://twitter.com/USMS_Philly?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@USMS_Philly</a> in the 1200 block of Foulkrod Street. Hylton was found at a known associate&#039;s residence after investigators from the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force received an anonymous tip. <a href="https://t.co/Y3iaZYUv0i">pic.twitter.com/Y3iaZYUv0i</a></p>&mdash; U.S. Marshals Service Philadelphia (@USMS_Philly) <a href="https://twitter.com/USMS_Philly/status/1869951599063269520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>



<p>The shooting happened just after 4:30 p.m. on Dec. 13, 2024, on the west side of City Hall near 15th and Market streets, police said.</p>



<p>According to Deputy Commissioner Frank Vanore, officers assigned to the area reported hearing four to five gunshots near the ice rink.</p>



<p>The officers moved quickly to the area where the shots were fired and found two 14-year-olds suffering from gunshot wounds, Vanore explained. </p>



<p>&#8220;People just coming here to visit, spend a little money and enjoy themselves. And all the sudden terror breaks out for no reason,&#8221; George Driver, who was visiting Dilworth Park, said. </p>



<p>This all happened adjacent to the ice skating rink when a fight broke out between the teenagers, Vanore said. According to investigators, the fight stemmed from someone bullying the younger brother of one of the teens. During the argument, a gun was fired. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s inexcusable,&#8221; Vanore told reporters at the scene. &#8220;Having a gun is dangerous at any venue.&#8221;</p>



<p>One of the teens, a 14-year-old boy, was shot in the face and taken to a nearby hospital, where he is listed in extremely critical condition, according to police. A second victim, a 15-year-old boy, was shot in the thigh and listed in stable condition at a nearby hospital.</p>



<p>Police confirmed late on Friday night that a third boy, 14, was brought to the Children&#8217;s Hospital of Philadelphia by his mother with a gunshot wound to his calf. He was listed in stable condition.  </p>



<p>Vanore explained that another 14-year-old boy was detained by the officers at the scene. Police said he is being charged as an adult with aggravated assault, PIC, REAP and conspiracy. </p>



<p>On Dec. 18, 2024, Vanore announced that police identified two more 14-year-old boys as suspects in the shooting and served warrants at their home. One of the teen suspects was arrested Wednesday morning and charged with aggravated assault, conspiracy and other related offenses. </p>



<p>Police continue to search for the third suspect. They are also searching for anyone else who may have been involved in the fight and shooting. </p>



<p>Police continue to look for more witnesses and evidence as the investigation continues, Vanore said. </p>

<p>One vendor, Lily Lough, was helping customers at her jewelry booth when the incident happened. Lough said that when they heard what sounded like gunshots, it took a second to register what was happening.</p>



<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t believe ourselves,&#8221; Lough explained. &#8220;We just stayed down.&#8221;</p>



<p>Once they realized there was a shooting, Lough and her customers hid under the table inside her booth and covered themselves with metal chairs. </p>



<p>&#8220;It was very scary,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All I saw was people running away.&#8221;</p>



<p>The skating rink stayed closed for the rest of Friday night. </p>

<p>Center City District President and CEO Prema Katari Gupta released a statement regarding the shooting: </p>



<p><em>&#8220;We are deeply saddened by the shooting that occurred early yesterday evening in Dilworth Park, a space we are committed to maintaining as a safe and welcoming environment for the region. Our hearts go out to the three teenagers who were injured and all those impacted by senseless violence.</em></p>



<p><em>The safety of visitors, merchants and park staff is our highest priority. Immediately after we received word of the incident, we shut down operations at Dilworth Park, including the rink, the cabin and the Made in Philadelphia Holiday Market. Today, and in the coming days, we will be working with police and city officials to ensure that Dilworth Park remains a safe and welcoming space for everyone.</em></p>



<p><em>It is important to emphasize that this was an isolated incident at Dilworth Park, which has seen more than 11 million visitors so far this year. A full complement of CCD’s dedicated on-street team is deployed at the park every day, including safety patrol staff and Community Service Representatives, and we will continue working to ensure that it remains a space for patrons to enjoy, during the holidays and year-round.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Nine puppies are now safe after being found inside a box in a Pennsylvania park earlier this week.</p>



<p>Pennsylvania SPCA shared that the puppies &#8212; only 4-week-old &#8212; were found in Merion Gateway Park. They had been left in the cold weather to fend for themselves. </p>



<p>The puppies were caked in feces, suffering from urine scalding, and in desperate need of care, the shelter added. </p>



<p>After being gently bathed and  medically examined, all of the puppies were placed into foster homes. </p>

<p>&#8220;If won at that level, it would be the largest prize ever won in December and the seventh largest in Mega Millions history,&#8221; <a href="https://www.megamillions.com/News/2024/Mega-Millions-Continues-Rolling,-Now-at-$825-Milli.aspx" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.megamillions.com/News/2024/Mega-Millions-Continues-Rolling,-Now-at-$825-Milli.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the lottery said</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Did you win something Tuesday night?</strong></h2>



<p>Check your numbers because $1 million tickets were sold in California (two), Louisiana and Oklahoma and a Match 5 + Megaplier ticket worth $4 million was sold in North Carolina, Mega Millions said.</p>



<p>More than 1.8 million tickets sold in Tuesday&#8217;s draw matched at least the gold Mega Ball and are worth $2 or more.</p>



<p>The winning numbers in the Dec. 17, 2024, draw were 56, 66, 67, 68 and 69, with a Mega Ball of 18. That&#8217;s right, there were four consecutive numbers drawn &#8212; what&#8217;s the odds of that?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>When is the next Mega Millions draw?</strong></h2>



<p>Mega Millions draws numbers again on Friday, Dec. 20, 2024. Should no one win that one, the jackpot for the Christmas Eve drawing will be even more &#8220;Mega.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>When did someone last hit the Mega Millions jackpot?</strong></h2>



<p>It&#8217;s been since Sept. 10, 2024, since a ticket sold in Texas hit all five numbers and the Mega Ball to win an <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/winning-ticket-mega-millions-jackpot-sold-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$810 million jackpot</a>.</p>



<p>Mega Millions is played in 45 states, plus the Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>



<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Keep that umbrella handy Friday as a wintry mix of light snow and cold rain is expected to fall. However, for most people in the Philadelphia region, the snow shovels can stay packed away, for now.</p>



<p>The First Alert Weather Team is tracking a weakening clipper system and coastal low that could, however, bring up to a few inches of snow to the Lehigh Valley and high elevations of the Pennsylvania suburbs.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what to expect:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Light snow and chilly rain</strong></h2>



<p>Get ready for a chilly, damp and dreary Friday as a mix of rain and snow moves into our area. </p>



<p>A weakening clipper system from the Midwest will transfer its energy to low pressure offshore, bringing rain into Delaware and South Jersey. Expect a cold rain with temperatures in the 30s and 40s into the afternoon.</p>

<p>In Philadelphia, the atmosphere is slightly colder, so we’ll see a rain-snow mix during the day. However, with surface temperatures above freezing (upper 30s to low 40s), any snowflakes that fall will melt on contact. </p>



<p>&#8220;Most of the snow falling will be melting,&#8221; First Alert Weather meteorologist Bill Henley said.</p>

<p>For the Lehigh Valley and northern and western suburbs, snow showers are more likely to have developed Friday morning, with intermittent snow possible in the afternoon. Here too, surface temperatures above freezing will cause most daytime snowflakes to melt.</p>



<p>This system will linger into Friday evening, and as temperatures cool, light snow accumulation becomes possible. </p>

<p>The last few snow showers will end early Saturday morning. </p>



<p>Roads in Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania and New Jersey suburbs and northern Delaware should remain fine, but colder surfaces like grass and sidewalks north and west of the city might see some light accumulation.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, in colder suburbs and the Lehigh Valley you could be waking up to a slushy mix and even some snow on grass and colder surfaces when you wake up Saturday.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Where is most likely to see snow on the ground? When might snow fall?</strong></h2>



<p>Accumulations are most likely on colder surfaces like grass, cars, and sidewalks. with 1 2 inches possible in the Lehigh Valley. In the PA Suburbs and South Jersey, expect more of a slushy mix than significant accumulation.</p>



<p><strong>Lehigh Valley, colder neighborhoods in higher elevations:</strong> Up to 1 to 2 inches of snow. Temperatures near or just above freezing will limit how much snow accumulates on roadways during Friday afternoon.</p>

<p><strong>Philadelphia, surrounding communities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey:</strong> Expect more of a slushy mix than significant accumulation. Some spots in New Jersey could get over an inch, however.</p>



<p><strong>Jersey Shore</strong>: Mostly just chilly rain is expected.</p>

<p>A father and son pleaded guilty Thursday to orchestrating a brazen <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/three-men-charged-with-fraud-in-100-million-new-jersey-deli-scheme.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078402">stock manipulation</a> scheme involving a small, money-losing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/21/guilty-plea-in-100-million-new-jersey-deli-stock-fraud-case.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078402">New Jersey deli</a> whose publicly traded parent company had an improbable market capitalization of $100 million.</p>

<p>The men, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/27/100-million-new-jersey-deli-scam-feds-sought-to-jail-father-while-son-is-at-large.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078402">Peter Coker Sr.</a> and his former <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/16/nj-deli-fugitive-detained-bail.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078402">fugitive</a> son <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/14/new-jersey-deli-fugitive-leaves-thailand-for-us-court-date.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078402">Peter Coker Jr.</a>, are scheduled to be sentenced next spring in the case in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/media/1381281/dl?inline">U.S. District Court</a> in Camden, New Jersey, according to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/father-and-son-admit-role-international-market-manipulation-scheme-related-new-jersey">federal prosecutors</a>.</p>

<p>A third defendant, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/21/guilty-plea-in-100-million-new-jersey-deli-stock-fraud-case.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078402">James Patten</a>, pleaded guilty in December 2023 to the same charges of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with the company once known as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HWIN&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078402">Hometown International</a> and another firm.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the Cokers reached a deal with federal prosecutors that stipulates neither side will argue for more or less than a range of prison time at sentencing for both men. That agreement does not bind the judge to deliver sentences within those ranges.</p>

<p>For the 82-year-old Coker Sr., the range is zero to two years in prison. For his 56-year-old son, the range is 30 months to 50 months.</p>

<p>The Cokers and Patten each admitted their roles in the scheme to artificially boost the stock price of Hometown, whose only real business asset was the Your Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, as well as the shares of a shell company then known as E-Waste.</p>

<p>Hometown&#8217;s stock price rose by more than 900% as a result of the scheme. The price of E-Waste rose by nearly 20,000%.</p>

<p>The scam, which ran from 2014 through September 2022, involved coordinated trading of the stocks of both companies, creating a false impression of demand for their shares, which traded on OTC Marketplace.</p>

<p>The defendants during the conspiracy gained control of the companies&#8217; management and shares, with the aim of using them as vehicles for reverse mergers with privately held companies. Both companies ended up being merged in such deals with private firms.</p>

<p>Coker Sr., who lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, has been free on bond since his arrest in September 2022. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 13.</p>

<p>Zach Intrater, an attorney for the elder Coker, declined to comment on his guilty plea.</p>

<p>Coker Jr., a former Hong Kong resident, has been held without bail in the Essex County, New Jersey, jail since he was extradited from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/14/new-jersey-deli-fugitive-leaves-thailand-for-us-court-date.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108078402">Thailand</a> in March 2023. He is scheduled to be sentenced on April 2.</p>

<p>John Azzarello, a lawyer for Coker Jr., told CNBC, &#8220;He admitted to the fact that he held a large volume of stock in both companies in the names of [firms] that he controlled that were not in his name, and he admitted that he participated in the conspiracy to artificially inflate the prices of the stocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Azzarello said Coker Jr. has been jailed &#8220;under really, really tough conditions&#8221; in New Jersey, and &#8220;under deplorable conditions&#8221; for two months before that in a Thai prison after his arrest there.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very anxious to go forward to sentencing and put this behind him and go back to Asia where he built his career and his life since graduating college,&#8221; Azzarello said. &#8220;We are hopeful that we can convince the court that the appropriate sentence is at the bottom end of the agreement.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 2010, Patten pleaded guilty in New Jersey federal court to mail fraud, which was related to sending a client a false financial statement to cover up bad investments he made using her money. He was sentenced to 27 months in prison in that case.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fda.gov/food" target="_blank">FDA </a>is issuing multiple advisories for oysters and Manila clams that could be contaminated with Norovirus, a serious gastrointestinal illness.</p>



<p>In the case of <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-restaurants-and-retailers-not-serve-or-sell-and-consumers-not-eat-certain-oysters-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oysters from British Columbia</a> first recalled in California, a notice says the product should not be consumed or distributed and should be marked as &#8220;not safe&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t touch.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Consumers should not eat these potentially contaminated oysters. Consumers who have symptoms should contact their health care provider to report their symptoms and receive care,&#8221; the FDA said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">British Columbia oysters recall</h2>



<p>A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.issc.org/sites/default/files/uploads/-2024/recalls/sm-shellfish-recall-notice_press-release_final.pdf" target="_blank">recall </a>was issued by S&amp;M Shellfish Co in San Francisco, California, on Dec. 13 for shellstock sold as Fanny Bay, Buckley Bay and Royal Miyagi Oysters after multiple confirmed Norovirus illnesses were reported, according to the state.</p>



<p>The California recall says the concerned product was harvested in British Columbia from Dec. 1 to Dec. 9 by Pacific Northwest Shellfish and Union Bay Seafood. The affected certificate numbers are BC 740 SP and BC 6001 SP.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Urgent Product Recall&#8221; said any product that meets the recall criteria should be &#8220;IMMEDIATELY STOPPED&#8221; from consumption or distribution and should be returned or labeled &#8220;NOT SAFE, DON’T TOUCH and/or to be DESTROYED.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-restaurants-and-retailers-not-serve-or-sell-and-consumers-not-eat-certain-oysters-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The FDA issued an advisory</a> for these oysters on Dec. 18 to restaurants and food retailers in Arizona, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The FDA said affected product may have been shipped to those states.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">SAFETY ALERT: FDA advises restaurants &amp; retailers not to serve or sell &amp; consumers not to eat certain oysters fr British Columbia, Canada, potentially contaminated w/ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/norovirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#norovirus</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Washington state oysters and Manila clams advisory</h2>



<p>A second issue first was flagged by Washington State which <a href="https://www.issc.org/sites/default/files/uploads/-2024/recalls/wa-recall-12-12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started a recall of shellstock</a> on Dec. 12. The product was initially reported as being shipped within Washington and to California.</p>



<p>The oysters and Manila clams in question were harvested from Nov. 15 to Dec. 11 by Rudy&#8217;s Shellfish from the Pickering Passage growing area of Washington state, according to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-restaurants-and-retailers-not-serve-or-sell-and-consumers-not-eat-certain-oysters-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FDA</a>. Consumers and businesses are advised to look at the packing label for information on the harvest date and location matching these details.</p>



<p>The FDA says the affected food may have been sent to restaurants and food stores in Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York and Washington state.</p>



<p>&#8220;The FDA is awaiting further information on distribution of these oysters and Manila clams and will continue to monitor the investigation and provide assistance to state authorities as needed,&#8221; the FDA said.</p>

<p>‘Tis the season to give back—and receive a little extra help.</p>



<p>With Thanksgiving and Christmas coming up it’s the perfect time to know about what local organizations in our area are doing to help those in need.</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking for a place to give, you and your family are in need, or you know someone who is, here are some organizations making a difference this holiday season.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Big Toy Giveaways at the Jersey Shore</h2>



<p>Salvation Army in Atlantic City and Asbury Park have tons of toys for families in need for Christmas.</p>



<p>The non-profit has kicked off a two-day toy distribution to help brighten the holiday for more than 500 deserving kids.</p>



<p>“Last year they served 200 families, and so we&#8217;re up to 250 families this year. So, the need has grown,&#8221; Lt. Lesley Colon, with the Salvation Army Atlantic City, said.</p>

We will use this time to reevaluate the overall operations of the show – reevaluating community engagement, assessing costs, reviewing logistics and creatively considering what future Atlantic City Airshows could look like. It is our sincere hope that we will once again be in a position to hold an Airshow in 2026,” a spokesperson wrote. </p>



<p>“Our goal is to ensure the long-term viability of the Airshow – it is New Jersey’s largest free event, a 20-year tradition, that has brought joy to hundreds of thousands of visitors and residents alike. We recognize the Airshow&#8217;s significant role in our community and to the tourism economy, and we are steadfast in our dedication to preserving its legacy, while adapting to current economic realities.”</p>

The cancellation occurred after the South Jersey Transportation Authority <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/politics/atlantic-city-airshow-2024-funding/3808239/">provided hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> in funding to save the 2024 show earlier this year. Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small said it costs around $300,000 to put on the show.</p>



<p>Small told NBC10 in July that the airshow brings in more than 500,000 people over the two-day span in August, leading to a $50 million dollar economic boom for the Atlantic City area.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>One of the five suspects in <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/suspect-in-murder-of-roxborough-high-student-nicolas-elizalde-pleads-guilty/3980201/">the deadly shooting of Philadelphia high school student Nicolas Elizalde</a> has learned his fate.</p>



<p>Zyheid Jones, 19, was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner announced on Thursday, Dec. 19, 2024.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1200&#038;strip=all&#038;resize=1200%2C675" alt="Nicolas Elizalde (right) stands next to his mother, Meredith." class="wp-image-7438351" srcset="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1200&#038;strip=all&#038;resize=1200%2C675 1200w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=218&amp;strip=all 218w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300&amp;strip=all 300w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768&amp;strip=all 768w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=850&amp;strip=all 850w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=600&amp;strip=all 600w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=500&amp;strip=all 500w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=400&amp;strip=all 400w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320&amp;strip=all 320w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=200&amp;strip=all 200w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=100&amp;strip=all 100w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/09/09292022-nicolas-elizalde.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1920&amp;strip=all 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Nicolas Elizalde (right) stands next to his mother, Meredith.</figcaption></figure>



<p>On Sept. 27, 2022, 14-year-old Nicolas Elizalde, was with a group of high school football players following a scrimmage at Roxborough High School when several gunmen jumped out of a parked SUV and opened fire.</p>



<p>Elizalde – who police say was an innocent bystander – was struck and killed in the shooting. Four other teens were injured.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">
<p><em>There are additional resources for people or communities that have endured gun violence in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://resolvephilly.org/gun-violence-resource/" target="_blank"><em>Further information can be found here.</em></a></p>
</div>



<p>Police arrested Zyheid Jones, 17-year-old Troy Fletcher, Dayron Burney-Thorn, Saleem Miller and Yaaseen Bivins in connection to the shooting.</p>



<p>In September 2024, Jones was found guilty of third-degree murder, conspiracy, attempted murder and related gun offenses. He was also found guilty of shooting and killing 19-year-old Tahmir Jones a day before Elizalde’s murder.</p>



<p>Fletcher also pleaded guilty to third-degree murder, conspiracy, attempted murder and other related offenses on Tuesday, Dec. 17, 2024. He is scheduled to be sentenced in February 2025.</p>



<p>Burney-Thorn, Miller and Bivins are scheduled to face trial in October 2025.</p>



<p>“We can only hope that the family and friends of Nicolas and Tahmir will find some solace with this outcome,” Krasner said. “And while convictions won&#8217;t bring back Nicolas and Tahmir nor heal the physical and psychological scars endured by Nicolas&#8217; classmates who were injured in this heinous act, my office will&nbsp;vigorously pursue justice against the remaining defendants and hold them accountable, and we&nbsp;will continue to support the co-victims of this senseless tragedy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whoville might not be safe, but one New Jersey animal shelter is ensuring no furry friends are falling victim to the Grinch&#8217;s schemes this holiday season by offering discounted dog adoptions. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.homewardboundnj.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.homewardboundnj.org/">Homeward Bound Pet Adoption Center</a> in Blackwood posted a video on social media with the caption, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let the Grinch steal adoptions!&#8221; </p>



<p>In the video, the mean one, Mr. Grinch, could be seen sneaking through the shelter halls, up to no good. </p>



<p>The overcrowded shelter wants to find homes for as many dogs as possible, so from now through Sunday, Dec. 22, you can adopt a dog for $12. </p>



<p>“Our shelter is full of loving animals just waiting to find a home,”&nbsp;said&nbsp;Commissioner Jeffrey Nash, liaison to the animal shelter. “If you can, take advantage of this discount and visit the&nbsp;Homeward&nbsp;Bound&nbsp;Pet Adoption Center this week.”</p>



<p>Small dogs and puppies under 6 months old are not included in this adoption special, according to the shelter. </p>







<p>Before the Grinch takes any dogs home to Mt. Crumpit with his sidekick, Max, think about adopting a new furry friend today! </p>



<p>The adoption center is open Tuesday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Friday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>



<p>To see all the adoptable dogs, visit <a href="https://www.homewardboundnj.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.homewardboundnj.org/">www.homewardboundnj.org</a>.</p>

<p>As if we needed another reason to love Kylie Kelce she adds one more to the list.</p>



<p>Kelce helped a Philadelphia teacher pull a Christmas miracle for high school students.</p>



<p>Bonnie Giberson, a teacher at Penn Treaty School, took to the social media platform TikTok asking her followers for help to raise the funds needed to rent a school bus to take her students to Lincoln Financial Field for a tour. </p>



<p>&#8220;This is a cry for help,&#8221; Ms. Giberson said in the video. &#8220;So, please, help me out, help my kids out. It’s like 40 of us. We can all fit on one bus. Just help us. It&#8217;ll be a Christmas miracle.&#8221;</p>



<p>The field trip was scheduled for Thursday, Dec. 19 and Ms. Giberson explained in the video that if she couldn&#8217;t raise the funds in time, she would be forced to cancel the excursion. </p>



<p>So she asked her followers for help connecting with someone at the Philadelphia Eagles. </p>



<p>This is where <a href="https://people.com/kylie-kelce-sponsors-class-trip-to-philadelphia-eagles-stadium-8763143" data-type="link" data-id="https://people.com/kylie-kelce-sponsors-class-trip-to-philadelphia-eagles-stadium-8763143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the &#8220;people&#8217;s princess&#8221; of the Philadelphia region</a> comes into the story. </p>



<p>Ms. Giberson took to TikTok for a follow up where she explained that she got a call from Kelce during the middle of the school day with an offer to pay for the class to get to the Linc. </p>



<p>“Did not expect to get a call from Kylie [Kelce] while I was at school. I did not know what to say and it was probably embarrassing,&#8221; Ms. Giberson said in the video. </p>



<p>The 40 students who got to tour the Linc on Thursday were all seniors in their capstone class, and it was all thanks to their teacher with help from the one and only Kylie Kelce. </p>

<p>While at the Linc, the students got a surprise visit by Eagles star Brandon Graham while touring the locker room. </p>



<p>Graham talked with the students and encouraged them to go to college. He told them that&#8217;s where he got to meet new people and interact with those that are different from him. </p>



<p>“Take a chance. You don’t know what’s going to happen but you can’t give up, can’t quit,&#8221; Graham said. “Whatever you do, just make sure you go hard at it.”</p>

<p>Philadelphia police have arrested a man for the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/mlk-high-body-shooting/3977502/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/mlk-high-body-shooting/3977502/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">murder of a 16-year-old boy who was found shot to death outside of Martin Luther King High School in September</a>.</p>



<p>Shyd Carr-Hanks, 19, was taken into custody as a person of interest for the homicide of William Honesty Jr. on Wednesday, Dec. 18, police said.</p>



<p>Carr-Hanks, from East Germantown, was officially charged with murder for the homicide on Thursday, Dec. 19. He was also charged with having a gun without a license and related offenses.</p>



<p>The shooting took place on Sunday, Sept. 22, 2024, when officers responded to the 5900 block of Stenton Avenue for the report of an unconscious person on a patch of grass outside of Martin Luther King High School.</p>



<p>When officers arrived, they found the Honesty lying on the ground suffering from multiple gunshot wounds to the chest, according to the police.</p>



<p>The victim was pronounced dead by medics at the scene at 11:46 p.m. that day.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">

</div>



<p>According to the original information police released on the incident, it was unclear how long Honesty was lying on the ground and there were no reports of shots fired in the area.</p>



<p>No motive for the shooting&nbsp;has been revealed by officials at this time.</p>



<p>At the time of the shooting, police were also looking into if it was connected to another shooting that happened that same night at 10:35 p.m. where a 19-year-old was shot.</p>



<p>Police have not released any new information on that shooting.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Police said they hope a photo of a bearded man behind the wheel of an SUV heading into Philadelphia will help them track down the hit-and-run killer of <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/deadly-levick-hit-and-run/4015858/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/deadly-levick-hit-and-run/4015858/">a woman who was launched more than 200 feet</a> out of her shoes.</p>



<p>Medics and police officers rushed to the 4800 block of Levick Street around 2:15 a.m. on Friday, Nov. 1, 2024, to find a woman with trauma throughout her body on the street, Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Scott Small said at the time. Medics pronounced her dead a short time later.</p>



<p>On Thursday, Dec. 19, 2024, police shared a photo of a bearded man driving what investigators believe is a 2008 black Nissan Murano through a bridge toll entering Philadelphia before the crash nearly two months earlier.</p>



<p>The SUV had a temporary Virginia paper tag on it, police said.</p>

<p>Police hoped to track down the driver in &#8220;reference to a fatal hit &amp; run crash involving a pedestrian&nbsp;that occurred on the 4800 block of Levick Street.&#8221;</p>



<p>A witness in another vehicle on the morning of the deadly crash told investigators they saw a dark-colored SUV speeding westbound &#8220;at a very high rate of speed&#8221; down Levick Street as it slammed into the woman &#8212; who police have not yet identified &#8212; as she crossed Levick Street at Edmund Street, Small said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Her body was clearly launched a distance of about 200 feet in a westbound direction,&#8221; Small said. &#8220;She was hit with such force that she was knocked out of both of her sneakers.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Law enforcement officials in Montgomery County have announced the arrest of a 21-year-old Harleysville man after a couple from Hatfield Township was killed in a crash that happened on June 8, 2024.</p>



<p>According to police officials, Michael Lennon, 21, of Harleysville, has been arrested and charged with homicide by vehicle while DUI, reckless endangerment and related offenses for his, alleged, involvement in a crash along Bethlehem Pike that killed Jaime Burgos, 87, and 80-year-old Eva Burgos, both of Hatfield Township. </p>



<p>Officials claim that, at about 6 p.m. on June 8, 2024, Lennon was driving a 2011 Ford Escape at a high rate of speed, southbound along Bethlehem Pike, when he attempted to turn at Bergey Road and lost control of his vehicle. </p>



<p>At that time, law enforcement officials claim, Lennon&#8217;s vehicle struck a plastic divider at that intersection and traveled over an island and through delineators, before striking the front drivers side and rear door of a Toyota Camry carrying a driver and three passengers &#8212; including Jaime and Eva Burgos. </p>



<p>The couple were taken to a nearby hospital after the crash where they were pronounced, officials said. </p>



<p>According to police, at the scene of the crash, Lennon told officers he &#8220;had marijuana and a bong&#8221; inside his vehicle &#8212; which officers allegedly recovered &#8212; and he tested positive to being under the influence of marijuana at the time the incident occurred. </p>



<p>Inside the vehicle, police official said, officers also recovered several empty marijuana containers, three containers of medical marijuana and a vaping device. </p>



<p>Lennon is in police custody on $200,000 bail. He has a preliminary hearing scheduled for Jan. 20, 2025. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>After weeks of concerns over drones hovering over New Jersey communities, the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.faa.gov/">Federal Aviation Administration</a> has stepped in to stop the flight of unmanned aircraft by banning the flying machines over certain locations.</p>



<p>&#8220;At the request of federal security partners, the FAA published 22 Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) prohibiting drone flights over critical New Jersey infrastructure,&#8221; The FAA told NBC10 on Dec. 19, 2024.</p>



<p>On Dec. 18, 2024, the FAA <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tfr.faa.gov/tfr_map_ims/html/cc/scale4/tile_8_4.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://tfr.faa.gov/tfr_map_ims/html/cc/scale4/tile_8_4.html" target="_blank">issued temporary flight restrictions (TFRs)</a> for communities up and down the Garden State. Specific locations in <a href="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8584.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8584.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burlington</a>, <a href="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8570.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8570.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camden</a>, <a href="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8842.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8842.html">Evesham</a>, <a href="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8569.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8569.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gloucester City</a>, <a href="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8583.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8583.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hamilton</a> and <a href="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8598.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8598.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Winslow</a> are among the spots in 22 other communities under TFRs through at least Jan. 17, 2025. </p>



<p>The TFRs are targeted to 1 nautical mile radii and heights of 400 feet over certain sites. For example, the <a href="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8842.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_4_8842.html">Evesham TFR</a> (updated on Thursday, Dec. 19, 2024) covers &#8220;from the surface up to and including 400 feet AGL&#8221; for 1 nautical mile and around &#8220;the MC GUIRE VORTAC (GXU) 258 degree radial at 13.7 nautical miles. (Latitude: 39º55&#8217;05&#8243;N, Longitude: 74º52&#8217;04&#8243;W),&#8221; according to the FAA.</p>



<p>You can click on the town names above to see the specifics of the restricted air space. </p>



<p>Some of <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/south-jersey-drone-flights/4047195/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/south-jersey-drone-flights/4047195/">those communities are among</a> many where drones have been spotted.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>What is a temporary flight restriction?</strong></h2>



<p>On its website, the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/where_can_i_fly/airspace_restrictions/tfr" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/where_can_i_fly/airspace_restrictions/tfr">FAA defines what a TFR means</a>.</p>



<p><em>Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) are defined areas of airspace where the FAA limits aircraft operations because of:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Temporary hazardous conditions, such as a wildfire, hurricane, or chemical spill.</em></li>



<li><em>A security-related event, such as the United Nations General Assembly.</em></li>



<li><em>Other special situations, like&nbsp;VIP&nbsp;movement.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em>The text of the actual&nbsp;TFR&nbsp;contains the details about the restriction, including the size, altitude, and time period of the&nbsp;TFR, and what types of operations are restricted and permitted.</em></p>



<p>The New Jersey TFRs are for &#8220;Temporary flight restrictions for Special Security Reasons,&#8221; according to the FAA. Special permission or purpose must be given to fly an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) during the TFR.</p>



<p>Utility PSE&amp;G confirmed to NBC10 on Thursday that they had requested TFRs for some locations. &#8220;This is part of our ongoing process working with the appropriate authorities,&#8221; PSE&amp;G said. &#8220;The safety and security of our employees, customers and communities are our top priority and we will continue to work with authorities.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Department of Homeland Security stressed the no-fly restrictions are for drones only and that manned aviation, including airplanes and helicopters, aren&#8217;t included.</p>



<p>What if a drone operator breaks the no-fly zone? &#8220;The FAA investigates all Temporary Flight Restriction violations,&#8221; the agency told NBC10. &#8220;Pilots who violate TFRs can face sanctions ranging from warnings or fines to certificate suspensions or revocations. The sanction depends on the circumstances of the violation.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>What has been seen over NJ?</strong></h2>



<p>A large number of mysterious drones have been reported flying over New Jersey and across the eastern U.S., sparking speculation and concern over where they came from and why.</p>



<p>The FBI, the Homeland Security Department and state agencies have been investigating, but officials say there has been&nbsp;nothing so far to suggest&nbsp;that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. In fact, authorities say, many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars.</p>



<p>President Joe Biden said Tuesday night that there appears to be nothing nefarious about the flying objects.</p>



<p>“There are a lot of drones authorized. We are following this closely. So far no sense of danger,” the Democrat said as he left the White House for a trip to Delaware.</p>

<p>Despite federal officials&#8217; comments, many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly unmanned aircraft — and for the authority to shoot them out of the sky. That&#8217;s something the FBI says not to do.</p>



<p>&#8220;Putting someone else’s life in danger is not the answer,&#8221; said Nelson Delgado, of the FBI&#8217;s Newark office.</p>



<p>The urgent warning from the FBI and New Jersey State Police follows an alarming number of instances involving people shining lasers into the eyes of manned aircraft mistaken for drones. The powerful lights from people on the ground can be dangerously blinding.</p>



<p>Dozens of witnesses&nbsp;have reported seeing drones&nbsp;statewide since mid-November, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.</p>



<p>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said Monday that drone-detection equipment supplied by the federal government has yielded little new information. He declined to describe the equipment except to say it was powerful and could even disable the drones, though he said that’s not legal on U.S. soil.</p>



<p>Murphy urged Congress to give states more authority to deal with the drones.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the FBI and New Jersey state police warned against pointing lasers at suspected drones, because aircraft pilots are being hit in the eyes more often. Authorities also said they are concerned people might fire weapons at manned aircraft that they have mistaken for drones.</p>



<p>&#8220;We continue to assess there is no public safety threat relating to the reported drone sightings,&#8221; U.S. Department of Homeland Security assistant press secretary Dana Gallagher said Thursday. &#8220;In coordination with the FAA and our critical infrastructure partners who requested temporary flight restrictions over their facilities, out of an abundance of caution, the FAA has issued temporary flight restrictions over some critical infrastructure facilities in New Jersey.&#8221;  </p>

<p>A child and a woman have been hospitalized after a house fire at a home in North Philadelphia early Thursday, officials said.</p>



<p>According to fire officials, crews were dispatched to a home along the 1500 block of North Gratz Street in North Philadelphia at about 6:33 a.m. on Thursday, Dec. 19, 2024. </p>



<p>According to Brandon Wilson, a battalion chief with the Philadelphia Fire Department, crews pulled a 5-year-old boy and a woman &#8212; whom Wilson initially believed to be the child&#8217;s grandmother &#8212; out of the home.</p>



<p>In a morning update, police officials said the woman was 38-years-old, but did not disclose her relationship to the injured child. </p>

<p>A third person who escaped the home was located by fire crews at the scene as well, Wilson said. </p>



<p>Crews were able to get the flames under control by about 6:49 a.m.</p>



<p>The boy is considered to be in critical condition and the woman suffered minor injuries, Wilson said.  </p>



<p>However, Wilson did not detail what may have caused this fire, but he said, an investigation is ongoing. </p>



<p><strong><em>This is a breaking news story. It will be updated as new information becomes available. </em></strong></p>

<p>The suspect charged with shooting to death the UnitedHealthcare chief executive on a Manhattan street has waived his extradition to New York and has been transported back to New York City.</p>



<p>Luigi Mangione&#8217;s decision Thursday to waive his extradition from Pennsylvania cleared the way for his return.</p>



<p>Federal prosecutors also filed a federal complaint against Mangione on Thursday charging him with murder through use of a firearm, two counts of stalking and a firearms offense.</p>



<p>Mangione appeared in a Manhattan federal court for an afternoon hearing where a magistrate ordered he be detained.</p>







<p>&#8220;Today, the Justice Department has brought federal murder charges against Luigi Mangione,&#8221; U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. &#8220;As alleged, Mangione planned his attack for months and stalked his victim for days before murdering him — methodically planning when, where, and how to carry out his crime.&nbsp; I am grateful to our state and local law enforcement partners for their tireless efforts to locate and apprehend the defendant and to ensure that he answers for his alleged crime.”</p>



<p>In federal court Thursday, Mangione shifted his head but otherwise did not react when the magistrate read the part of the complaint accusing him of killing Thompson.</p>



<p>His attorney said dealing with both the state and federal cases puts the defense in a highly unusual situation. “Frankly I’ve never seen anything like what is happening here,” said Karen Friedman Agnifilo.</p>



<p>Outside court after the appearance, Agnifilo declined to comment.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to respectfully decline to make any comment this time. Mr. Mangione appreciates everyone&#8217;s support,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Mangione started the day attending early morning proceedings Thursday at the Blair County Courthouse in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania with his attorney Thomas Dickey. A preliminary hearing on local gun charges that was scheduled to happen before the extradition hearing was postponed.</p>



<p>The district attorney in Blair County, Pennsylvania, Pete Weeks, has said he was willing to put the Pennsylvania charges on hold while New York authorities prosecute Mangione for the Dec. 4 killing of UnitedHealthcare chief executive&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-shooting-79a9710978fc7adbb23d3fed4ea2f70d" target="_blank">Brian Thompson</a>. Mangione faces charges of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/luigi-mangione-indictment-ceo-killing-extradition/6076319/" target="_blank">murder as an act of terrorism</a>&nbsp;in New York.</p>



<p>During the hearing, Mangione was asked if he understood what he was doing by waiving extradition, to which he answered, &#8220;yes.&#8221; He then signed the paperwork agreeing to his transfer to New York custody.</p>



<p>Twelve NYPD officers were in court sitting in the front row of the hearing.</p>



<p>Mangione was then taken by a fixed-wing aircraft to MacArthur Airport on Long Island and from there was brought to a New York City helipad by NYPD helicopter for the appearance in front of a federal magistrate.</p>

<p>Mangione is accused of giving Pennsylvania police a fake New Jersey identification and having a gun and silencer in his bag.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pacourts.us/news-and-statistics/cases-of-public-interest/commonwealth-v-mangione" target="_blank">court filing</a>&nbsp;last week, Mangione defense attorney Tom Dickey argued prosecutors hadn&#8217;t shown there&#8217;s sufficient evidence to hold Mangione, that he was in New York when Thompson was killed or that he is a fugitive from justice.</p>



<p>Mangione, 26, of Towson, Maryland, was&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-suspect-ceo-assassin-shooter-eaee0b7d31b319f42e0cf7f2f7badfb1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested on Dec. 9</a>&nbsp;when police were called to a McDonald&#8217;s restaurant on a commercial strip in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after he was reported to match the description of Thompson&#8217;s killer.</p>



<p>Thompson was gunned down on the street as he walked to the hotel where his Minnesota-based company was holding an investor conference. The shooting was captured on security video, but the suspect eluded police before Mangione was captured about 277 miles (446 kilometers) west of New York.</p>

<p>Authorities say Mangione was carrying&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apnews.com/article/ghost-guns-unitedhealthcare-ceo-1e3b449dd9ed5fabeb2ad592fde91575" target="_blank">the gun</a>&nbsp;used to kill Thompson, a passport, a fake ID and about $10,000 in U.S. and foreign currency. His lawyer, Dickey, has questioned the evidence for the forgery charge and the legal basis for a gun charge. He had previously indicated Mangione would fight&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-extradition-04e0ca9b04804e3731f6619f04400994" target="_blank">extradition</a>&nbsp;to New York while being held in a Pennsylvania state prison.</p>



<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said she was prepared to file a governor&#8217;s warrant to order Mangione brought to New York in cooperation with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro if Mangione did not waive his extradition.</p>



<p>As of now, the Manhattan District Attorney&#8217;s charges against Luigi Mangione would have priority, and any possible future federal charge or charges would be second in prosecution order. </p>



<p>Mangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a prominent family, was carrying a handwritten letter that called health insurance companies “parasitic” and complained about corporate greed, according to a law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press last week.</p>



<p>Outside the Criminal Courts Building in Manhattan, some protesters could be seen with signs railing against the health insurance industry.</p>

<p>Earlier, Mayor Eric Adams condemned the support for Mangione and any apparent support for this alleged crime.</p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t use a gun and anyone that celebrates that, it is vile and it is sending the wrong message and you&#8217;ve celebrating using violence to solve an issue,&#8221; Adams said.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Virgen Martinez was driving to work one November morning in 2020 when at the same time a Philadelphia Police vehicle was pursuing a suspected drug dealer driving a gray SUV.</p>



<p>Just as Martinez was crossing Allegheny and Frankford avenues, the SUV plowed through a red light, T-boning her car on the driver’s side and causing her vehicle to strike a pedestrian on the crosswalk, sending him airborne.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pedestrian was critically injured.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martinez died minutes later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They just think about that person. Oh, we have to get this person,” Martinez’s sister Carmen said, still grief-stricken four years later. “But you don&#8217;t know everything else that you&#8217;re putting in jeopardy other people&#8217;s life.”</p>



<p>An internal affairs investigation into the chase found that the two officers in the police vehicle violated the<a href="https://www.phillypolice.com/assets/directives/D9.4-VehicularPursuits.pdf"> city’s pursuit policy</a>.</p>







<p>And yet that pursuit does not appear in the <a href="https://www.policepursuits.pa.gov/">Pennsylvania Police Reporting System</a>. Pennsylvania law requires police agencies throughout the commonwealth to <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/75/75.HTM" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/75/75.HTM">report all pursuits to the state police system.</a></p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a shame. It&#8217;s a shame,” Carmen Martinez said. “She&#8217;s a human being. And the way they treated this case is like she&#8217;s an animal.”</p>



<p>The NBC10 Investigators found that it wasn’t just the Martinez case but dozens of other Philadelphia Police pursuits between 2019 and this year that have not been reported to state police as required by law. That means pursuits that have left people dead, injured, and resulted in property damage have been left out of the statistics used to produce an annual report.</p>



<p>“If you don&#8217;t have the data, you don&#8217;t know what that problem is and you don&#8217;t know how to fix it,” said Geoff Alpert, a criminal justice professor at the University of South Carolina who has studied police pursuits for several decades.</p>



<p>And the<a href="https://www.policepursuits.pa.gov/PDF/2023_Annual_Report.pdf"> annual pursuit report </a>agrees with that. It says that the report is meant to “identify both positive and negative factors influencing the outcome of vehicular pursuits, validate or refute the merits of pursuit policies,” and goes on to say that the “analysis of pursuit statistics enhances the safety of police officers and the public they serve.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alpert says it’s important to keep track of not just the number of pursuits but the reason for a pursuit and outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If someone gets injured or killed and particularly an innocent bystander. Why? And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to have the data,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>State Police has 40 points of data that are supposed to be filled out after each pursuit&#8211; providing insight into road conditions, crimes associated with pursuits, injuries and deaths. Despite listing<a href="https://www.phillypolice.com/assets/directives/D9.4-VehicularPursuits.pdf"> the nine-page state police form </a>in its pursuit policy, Philly has skipped all of that entirely for the majority of its pursuits in the last five years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we reached out to state police about the incomplete Philly data, a spokesperson said in a statement that the agency is “committed to compiling accurate and comprehensive” pursuit data. </p>



<p>“PSP is not responsible for whether a police department reports their data correctly or completely,&#8221; the spokesperson said. &#8220;PSP is only required to collect, analyze, and compile.”</p>



<p>The city does keep some of its own stats &#8211; but they are not consistent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, one data set shows 136 pursuits in 2022 while another shows 82 pursuits for that same year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most recent PPD-provided dataset shows 145 pursuits for 2023. But the official state pursuit dashboard only shows one pursuit for 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the NBC10 Investigators started asking about the data discrepancy, PPD Deputy Commissioner Francis Healey told us the department found issues with its record-keeping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It just hasn&#8217;t been reported properly. So we&#8217;re going to look into it,” Healey said. “I just became aware of it rather recently.”</p>



<p>Healey says the department has a strict pursuit policy and that it investigates every chase.</p>



<p>“I understand the data needs to be reported correctly but don&#8217;t infer that these aren&#8217;t being investigated,” he said. “They&#8217;re all investigated by our crash investigations unit.”</p>



<p>There is no penalty for police agencies that don’t file complete data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any changes to that would have to be decided by the state legislature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>State Rep. Joe Hohenstein is a member of the statehouse transportation and judiciary committees. He said he plans to ask both committees to look into the pursuit data gathering process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I won&#8217;t commit that we would need to make it punitive, but there may be more accountability measures,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>After more than seven decades of serving the South Philadelphia community and beyond, Bomb Bomb Bar B Que Grill is closing. </p>



<p>The family behind the popular restaurant &#8212; located on the corner of South Warnock and Wolf Streets &#8212;  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bombbombphilly/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/bombbombphilly/">shared in a post on social media</a> that they will shut the doors on Saturday, Dec. 28. </p>



<p>The statement read in part: </p>



<p><em>&#8220;The Bomb Bomb Barbato family, through 3 generations, has been proud and fortunate to have served the Philadelphia, Delaware County and South Jersey communities for over 73 years. Frank and Deb Barbato will be retiring and closing our doors December 28th</em></p>

<p>This holiday season, the very last of one local family&#8217;s Christmas trees are being shaken, bundled and getting their fresh cuts. </p>



<p>After this Christmas Eve, the <a href="https://www.poynterstreefarm.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.poynterstreefarm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poynter&#8217;s Tree Farm</a> and ornament shop is closing for good. </p>



<p>The family behind the beloved holiday tradition says that they&#8217;ll miss their customers, but they say this is just the right time to say goodbye. </p>

<p>Jeannie Wood and her father made their very first sale back in 1970 when Bob and Bonnie Poynter started the farm in Felton, Delaware, to help pay for their three daughters&#8217; college dreams. </p>



<p>The farm became a tradition for many in Kent County and a way for the family to come back together every holiday season. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ve all been doing it for a long time so I think we are all ready to retire,&#8221; Wood told NBC10. My dad and I planted the first trees in 1967.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Bob Poynter died a few years ago followed by his wife Bonnie last summer, the family agreed that this year would be the last for the tree farm. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be different but I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s gonna be like because we&#8217;ve never experienced it. We&#8217;ve always been doing this,&#8221; Wood said. </p>







<p>From the Christmas shop to the wreath workshop, it&#8217;s a bittersweet moment for the family and for their loyal customers. </p>



<p>Many of the customers come from a couple of hours away just to buy their tree at Poynter&#8217;s every year. </p>



<p>All of the trees that are ready for sale have been sold already. Before the family sells the land, they will have to decide what to do with all of the little trees that are still too small to be sold this year. </p>



<p>If you want to check out Poynter&#8217;s before they close, you have until Christmas Eve to shop for ornaments and nutcrackers. </p>

<p><strong><em>Editor&#8217;s note: Police confirmed on Thursday that the victim in this shooting was a 15-year-old girl. A previous version of this story said she was a woman in her early to mid-twenties. </em></strong></p>



<p>A teen girl was killed after being shot several times in North Philadelphia on Tuesday night, according to the police department. </p>



<p>The Philadelphia Police Department received several 911 calls reporting gunshots in the area of the 2700 block of North Dover Street just after 7 p.m. on Dec. 18, 2024, according to Chief Inspector Scott Small. </p>



<p><strong><em><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/adolescente-armada-muere-tiroteo-north-dover-street-filadelfia/2453866/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/adolescente-armada-muere-tiroteo-north-dover-street-filadelfia/2453866/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Léelo en español aquí</a></em></strong></p>



<p>When officers arrived to the scene they found a female wearing a fanny pack laying on the sidewalk very close to a private residence and suffering from gunshot wounds throughout her body, Small said. </p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">
<p><em>There are additional resources for people or communities that have endured gun violence in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://resolvephilly.org/gun-violence-resource/" target="_blank"><em>Further information can be found here.</em></a></p>
</div>



<p>The girl was unresponsive and police took her to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead, officials said. She did not have identification on her but she was identified on Thursday as a 15-year-old girl.  </p>



<p>Officers found a handgun inside her fanny pack, according to Small. </p>



<p>“The handgun was still secure inside of the fanny pack,&#8221; Small told reporters at the scene. “It appears that this female never got a chance to pull the weapon or shoot the weapon.&#8221;</p>



<p>Investigators said that many of the 21 spent shell casings found at the scene were located very close to where the teen was found lying, Small said. The shooter, or shooters, were standing very close to the victim when they opened fire. </p>



<p>Small explained that the teen appears to be the intended target. </p>

<p>A father-daughter team in southern Delaware is asking people not to shoot them out of the sky amid concerns about drone sightings along the East Coast. They&#8217;re one of the first five American families to own a BlackFly flying car.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had like 11 different airplanes,&#8221; said John Chirtea.</p>



<p>Chirtea and his daughter, Heather Chirtea, have a couple of planes in their hangar in Sussex County, Delaware. But the coolest in their collection isn&#8217;t technically a plane — or a drone. It&#8217;s a flying car.</p>



<p>Takeoff and landing is a little steep, but John, 86, said he loves flying the BlackFly around the countryside.</p>



<p>&#8220;When I was a kid, I always dreamed, laying in bed, of flying a magic carpet. I fly around in this thing. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m in a magic carpet,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The Chirteas are among the first five Americans to own a BlackFly personal air vehicle. They&#8217;re licensed pilots, but they say they only need a driver&#8217;s license to fly the BlackFly.</p>



<p>&#8220;We feel like this is manifest destiny. Like, we are the first people in America to actually have a flying car,&#8221; Heather Chirtea said.</p>



<p>The electric-powered flying car costs about $200,000 and can fly about 20 miles. It takes about 45 minutes to recharge.</p>



<p>John and Heather Chirtea believe there will soon be a lot of piloted and pilotless vehicles like the BlackFly in the American skies.</p>



<p>The personal air vehicle can go up to about 4,000 feet, but they generally don&#8217;t fly that high. Operators typically fly them about 250 feet above ground because they have to be sure they have the power to get back down safely. BlackFly vehicles do have parachute systems for emergency situations.</p>



<p>As reports of mysterious drones flying in the skies at night along the East Coast grow, the Chirteas said they don&#8217;t want people to mistake their flying car for a drone.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re damn right I don&#8217;t want anybody shooting at me,&#8221; John Chirtea said.</p>



<p>&#8220;What really concerns me is when politicians get on television and they say &#8216;Oh, we&#8217;re gonna shoot all these things down&#8217; and people think it&#8217;s OK to shoot down, you know, some vehicle they see in the sky. You don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a person in there,&#8221; Heather Chirtea said.</p>



<p>John Chirtea said he never flies the BlackFly at night.</p>



<p>Although concerning, he does love the attention the drones have brought to the potential of electric personal air vehicles like his.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are on the cutting edge of the new technology of how people are going to be flying,&#8221; John Chirtea said.</p>

<p>Something&#8217;s brewing at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temple.edu/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.temple.edu/">Temple University</a>. </p>



<p><a href="https://ironhillbrewery.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://ironhillbrewery.com/">Iron Hill Brewery and Restaurant</a> plans to open a new location on the university&#8217;s campus next to the Liacouras Center.</p>



<p>University officials said the <a href="https://news.temple.edu/news/2024-12-18/iron-hill-brewery-restaurant-plans-open-location-temple-s-campus" data-type="link" data-id="https://news.temple.edu/news/2024-12-18/iron-hill-brewery-restaurant-plans-open-location-temple-s-campus">project was approved</a> on Wednesday, Dec.18, during the Finance and Investment Committee meeting of the university’s Board of Trustees. </p>



<p>The new restaurant will be located at 1700 N. Broad St., the location that formerly housed one of the university&#8217;s bookstores. </p>



<p>“Over the last 28 years, Iron Hill Brewery has established a reputation as one of the premier eateries and breweries across the region. It is a brand that is synonymous with high quality, making this a tremendous addition to both Temple’s campus and North Philadelphia,” Temple University President John Fry said in a news release. “It is exciting to see a well-established, reputable organization like Iron Hill make such a strong investment in this community, and we are glad to have them as a partner. I suspect it won’t be long until Iron Hill becomes a go-to spot before and after games and events at the Liacouras Center.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iron Hill Brewery currently operates 19 locations across Pennsylvania, Delaware, Georgia, New Jersey and South Carolina. </p>



<p>The North Philadelphia location will be the organization&#8217;s 12th location in Pennsylvania and third in Philadelphia. </p>



<p>“The opening of Iron Hill Brewery &amp; Restaurant will be the latest addition to an area of both campus and North Philadelphia that is already undergoing a transformation,” Temple Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Ken Kaiser said. “We have needed a place where the Temple and North Philadelphia communities as well as visitors and alumni can meet and congregate, and we will soon have two excellent options for that with both Iron Hill and The Peabody set to open on campus.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Police in New Jersey are searching for two &#8220;naughty&#8221; suspects after they were caught on camera stealing a package off a resident&#8217;s porch and then returning the item days after a video of them twerking and taunting during the theft emerged online. </p>



<p>Gloucester Township Police shared that on Monday, Dec. 9, around 6:30 p.m., a victim&#8217;s Ring camera captured two individuals running up to their front door in the new Independence Square Townhomes in the Sicklerville section of Gloucester Township. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/ladron-paquetes-gloucester-township-sicklerville-nj-perreo/2453318/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/ladron-paquetes-gloucester-township-sicklerville-nj-perreo/2453318/">Léelo en español aquí</a>.</p>



<p>Police said one of the suspects grabbed an Amazon package containing four glasses and baby items valued at $74 from the porch. The other suspect also ran up to the front door and began taunting the resident on their camera by &#8220;twerking,&#8221; then, both suspects fled the area. </p>

<p>The victim posted the surveillance video on the Ring Neighbors app to warn the surrounding residents after the incident happened.</p>



<p>In a turn of events, on Wednesday, Dec. 11, around 7 p.m., police said the two suspects returned to the victim&#8217;s home. </p>



<p>Police said one of the suspects stayed across the street while the other suspect &#8212; who appeared to be the same person who was twerking during the initial theft &#8212;  approached the Ring camera, held up their phone with the Ring Neighbors app on the screen, and said, &#8220;Come on dude, not cool bro, come on not cool. That&#8217;s my a** on the internet!&#8221; Then he ran across the street. </p>



<p>Then, just 10 minutes later, police said one of the suspects returned a second time holding one of the stolen glasses &#8212; which was broken and said, &#8220;Uh, I meant to give this back&#8221; while placing it on the front step and fleeing the area once more, according to police. </p>



<p>If you can identify the suspect in the video and photos, you are asked to call the Gloucester Township Police Department at 856-228-4500. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Police in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, are using new technology to help them catch individuals involved in carjackings.</p>



<p>Officers now use license plate readers that detect when wanted cars enter the township. When a plate is flagged, police can see where and where the vehicle is going. </p>



<p>&#8220;That fact that officers can now get notified on their smartphone or their computer in the vehicle. Really, it&#8217;s a game changer,&#8221; said Bensalem&#8217;s Public Safety Director William McVey.</p>



<p>This new technology helped arrest <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/carjacked-vehicle-bensalem-township-arrest/4053900/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/carjacked-vehicle-bensalem-township-arrest/4053900/">several individuals in the township after police said they were driving around in a vehicle that was stolen</a> during an armed carjacking in Philadelphia. </p>

<p>In that incident, officers got an alert when the stolen vehicle entered the township, and they were able to gather and surround the suspects. </p>



<p>&#8220;When the officer tried to stop that vehicle, it took off at a high rate of speed,&#8221; said Mcvey. &#8220;They went behind an apartment complex where it dead end into about five other police cars that were coming into the area.&#8221; </p>



<p>Bensalem police said they are processing nearly 100,000 plates in a week. Officers can now pick up stolen car tags and suspended registrations. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>&#8216;Tis the season for Christmas trees! But when you’re putting up the tree and decorating it with beautiful lights, there are important safety tips to remember.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Clean your fireplace &nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you have a fireplace in your home, make sure you’ve cleared it all out before lighting it. Also make sure the chimney is cleaned as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Keep your tree away from heat sources</h2>



<p>One out of four tree fires are the result of a tree being too close to a heat source. Not only does that include your fireplace, but it also includes space heaters. So make sure you keep your tree at least three feet away from your fireplace, space heater or any other heat source.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Water your tree each day</h2>



<p>If you do have a live tree, make sure you continually water it daily as dry pine needles could become a safety hazard.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Smoke alarms and fire extinguisher</h2>



<p>Remember to always have a smoke alarm with fresh batteries and a fire extinguisher nearby in the event of a fire emergency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Be careful hanging your Christmas lights</h2>



<p>One out of three tree fires are the result of an electrical failure. As you’re hanging Christmas lights around your tree, remember to limit those strands to three or less.</p>

<p>Version 3.0 of SEPTA’s mobile app has officially launched, offering riders a new, modern and user-friendly experience. </p>



<p>In this upgrade, the transit agency said customers can plan their trips using a fully integrated trip planner, access real-time information on the go, manage their SEPTA Key Cards, and directly connect to SEPTA Transit Police and Customer Service without leaving the app.</p>



<p>“Riders using the latest version of our app will see new features that will make for a much simpler customer experience,” said Scott Sauer, SEPTA interim general manager. “This new app will encourage more ridership and make our customers feel more confident as they use the system.”</p>



<p>The app upgrade is part of SEPTA&#8217;s larger plan to enhance customer experience. The transit agency has already transformed its website and added new signage. </p>



<p>Features on the enhanced app include: </p>



<ul>
<li>A nearby map that shows stops and stations that are closest to you</li>



<li>Fully integrated trip planning functionality without leaving the app</li>



<li>Ability to report an issue to SEPTA Transit Police within the app, without needing to download the separate Transit Watch App</li>



<li>Detailed station information for every SEPTA station</li>



<li>Improved features for riders with accessibility needs, including full-screen reader compatibility</li>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A wild and historic NFC East streak is on the brink of being extended.</p>



<p>There has been a new champion in the NFC East each season for 19 straight years, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nfl.com/news/cowboys-win-second-nfc-east-title-in-three-seasons-with-win-over-commanders" target="_blank">longest streak without a repeat division winner</a> in <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl">NFL</a> history. And the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/" target="_blank">Philadelphia Eagles</a> (12-2) can keep it alive when they visit the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/sports/washington-commanders/" target="_blank">Washington Commanders</a> (9-5) in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/nfl-week-16-schedule-times-broadcast-tv-stream" target="_blank">Week 16</a> with a chance to clinch the 2024 NFC East title.</p>



<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/nfl-teams-clinch-eliminated-playoffs-2024-25" target="_blank">playoff-bound Eagles</a>, who can clinch with a win or tie, enter the division battle riding a franchise-record 10-game winning streak. They also own the NFL&#8217;s longest active winning streak after the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/nfl-week-15-winners-losers-lamar-jackon-mvp-dolphins-chiefs-bengals-bills-lions" target="_blank">Detroit Lions had their streak snapped at 11 in Week 15</a>. With just three weeks to go in the regular season, the Eagles, Lions and Minnesota Vikings all sit at 12-2 in the race for the NFC&#8217;s No. 1 seed.</p>



<p>Not even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/brandon-graham-apologizes-for-comments-about-hurts-brown-relationship" target="_blank">a little drama</a> last week surrounding quarterback <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/?s=jalen+hurts" target="_blank">Jalen Hurts</a>, wideout <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/?s=a.j.+brown" target="_blank">A.J.

<p>The Commanders, meanwhile, reached the nine-win mark for the first time since 2015 with a nail-biter of a 20-19 road win over the New Orleans Saints. New Orleans scored a touchdown as time expired in regulation to pull within one, but the Saints went for the win and failed on the two-point try. Washington now has a chance to clinch its first playoff berth since 2020 this week, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nfl.com/news/playoff-clinching-scenarios-for-week-16-of-2024-nfl-season" target="_blank">though they&#8217;ll need some help</a> in addition to getting a result against Philadelphia.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Michael Vick, one of the most electrifying quarterbacks in NFL history, will become the next head coach at Norfolk State University, according to multiple reports on Tuesday.</p>



<p>He will take over for Dawson Odums, who was fired on Nov. 26 after a 15-31 record in four seasons. Vick, 44, has no formal coaching experience but he&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/12/16/michael-vick-in-talks-to-become-norfolk-state-head-coach/" target="_blank">told The Virginian-Pilot this week</a>, &#8220;I know how to lead and I know what it takes.&#8221; He has been an NFL analyst for Fox Sports since 2017.</p>



<p>A Newport News, Virginia, native, Vick starred at Virginia Tech and led the Hokies to the BCS National Championship Game in 2000, losing to Florida State. He finished sixth for the Heisman Trophy that year and was drafted No. 1 overall in 2001 by the Atlanta Falcons.</p>



<p>Vick played 13 NFL seasons, including six with the Falcons and five with the Philadelphia Eagles. He was named a Pro Bowler four times and threw for 22,464 yards and 133 touchdowns in his career. But while he was a top-tier passer, Vick was most known for his ability to run.</p>



<p>His 6,109 yards is No. 1 in NFL history, and he ranks No. 8 in touchdowns with 36 on the ground. In 2008 he became the first quarterback to rush for 1,000 yards in a single season. Vick is recognized as helping revolutionize the position and has been cited numerous times for inspiring dual-threat quarterbacks in recent years.</p>



<p>Vick&#8217;s stardom took a major hit in 2007 when he pleaded guilty to his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20385308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involvement in a dog fighting ring</a>. He was released by the Falcons and spent 21 months in federal prison. After serving his sentence, the Eagles signed him in 2009. The following season he led Philadelphia to a division title and earned NFL Comeback Player of the Year.</p>



<p>He officially retired in 2016.</p>



<p>Vick will be the latest former NFL star to become a head coach at an historically Black college or university. Deion Sanders spent two years at Jackson State, compiling a 27-6 record, before leaving for Colorado in 2022. Eddie George just completed his fourth season at Tennessee State and led the Tigers to the FCS postseason.</p>

<p>An investigation is underway in New Castle County, Delaware, after a shooting victim flagged down a passing school bus for help on Tuesday, according to officials with the police department. </p>



<p>The shooting happened on Dec. 17 in the area of Old Forge Road near Appleby Road in the Wilton neighborhood, police said. </p>



<p>A spokesperson with the police department told NBC10 that a shooting victim flagged down a bus that was passing by for help. </p>



<p>No one on the bus was hurt and none of the children who were on the bus were in danger, the spokesperson said. </p>



<p>The bus is currently being held as evidence by investigators, police said. The victim was taken to a nearby hospital with non-life-threating injuries. </p>



<p>Officials warned everyone to avoid the area as several roads were closed and there was an increased police presence during the investigation. </p>



<p>The road was reopened a few hours later around 7:40 p.m., police said. </p>

<p>Two Philadelphia correctional officers have been arrested for smuggling contraband and narcotics into the prison system for profit, the Philadelphia District Attorney&#8217;s Office announced on Tuesday.</p>



<p>Roderick Price, 41, was arrested at his home in Philadelphia, and Christina Ingram, 23, was arrested while at work.</p>



<p>They both were charged with corrupt organization, criminal conspiracy, dealing in illegal proceeds, possession with intent to distribute controlled substances, and related charges.</p>



<p>Both correctional officers worked at Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility (CFCF) and are accused of operating two separate contraband smuggling schemes that illegally generated thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>During a separate investigation into a shooting and kidnapping, a detective discovered that an inmate involved in that case was receiving contraband. After that they discovered many inmates were receiving cell phones, charging cords, AirPods and narcotics from within the prison system, Assistant District Attorney Joseph Lanuti, also on the DAO Gun Violence Task Force, said. </p>



<p>They investigated where that contraband came from which led them to Price and Ingrim.</p>



<p>“It goes to the heart of the problem of corruption. Corruption that can endanger correctional officers. Corruption that can endanger inmates. Corruption that can endanger the general public in several different kinds of ways,” Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said.</p>



<p>Price and Ingram are accused of working with civilians to smuggle cell phones and Suboxone, a medicine used to treat people suffering from opioid use disorder, into the facility.</p>



<p>Both officers in this case were paid by inmates or their families through cash or digital payments. They were provided with the contraband outside the jail and would then smuggle them into the jail where they were sold, Lanuti said.</p>



<p>Investigators allege that Price and Ingrim did not worked together.</p>



<p>“They both had they own thing going, they had separate operations,” Krasner said.</p>



<p>Price has been a corrections officer since 2006. Ingram has been employed with the PDP since 2023.</p>



<p>Lanuti said they have seen instances where inmates use cell phones to contact and intimidate victims and witnesses of crimes, they also use them to communicate with co-conspirators outside the jail.</p>



<p>“Create a climate and a culture of lawlessness in that prison that is completely unacceptable,” Krasner</p>



<p>Krasner addressed staffing issues in the prisons, saying the city is doing everything it can to address this issue.</p>



<p>“While we need more correctional officers, we need officers with integrity who will uphold the law and their oath,” Philadelphia Department of Prisons Commissioner Michael Resnick said.</p>



<p>Krasner said the staffing issues are a result of the pandemic.</p>



<p>“We should always be concerned in any correctional institution with the possibility that there are some bad actors not just those that are in the cells but there are some bad actors in uniforms,” Krasner said.</p>
