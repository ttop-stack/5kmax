				<![CDATA[
<p>A major&nbsp;<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report released</a>&nbsp;this week found that compared with abstaining from alcohol, moderate drinking was linked to a lower risk of death from any cause and a lower risk of death from heart disease, but it was also linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.</p>



<p>Far from settling the debate over whether&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/drinking-alcohol-risks-supposed-benefits-rcna98759" target="_blank">drinking in moderation is healthy or dangerous</a>, the report’s conclusions further&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/drinking-moderately-not-healthier-than-abstaining-rcna77604" target="_blank">muddied the issue</a>.</p>



<p>The report, released Tuesday, was commissioned by Congress and carried out by a committee from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. An update to federal dietary guidelines next year could include new recommendations about how much alcohol people should drink.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current guidelines&nbsp;</a>recommend people limit alcoholic beverages and say that if they choose to drink, they should do so in moderation, defined as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over the last few years, mounting evidence has questioned the health benefits of drinking. In 2022, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;concluded that no amount of alcohol is safe. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aacr.org/about-the-aacr/newsroom/news-releases/aacr-cancer-progress-report-highlights-innovative-research-novel-treatments-and-powerful-patient-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large report</a>&nbsp;this year found that heavy drinking is linked to six cancers, including cancers of the head and neck, the esophagus, the liver and the stomach.</p>



<p>For the report, the committee reviewed research dating to 2010 to look at the relationship between moderate drinking and a number of outcomes, including death from any cause, death from heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, weight changes and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>



<div style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%" class="wp-block-embed is-type-video"><iframe class="wp-block-embed is-type-video" src="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/embedded-video/mmvo207945797633" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="yes"></iframe></div>



<p>“We looked at that body of literature and were able to make three conclusions with what we call moderate certainty, and what that means is that we feel comfortable in making these conclusions based on the evidence we had available,” said Dr. Ned Calonge, chair of the NASEM committee.</p>



<p>Calonge and his team stopped short of linking moderate drinking to colorectal cancer, saying there is insufficient evidence to make a firm conclusion, though that could change in the future with more research.</p>



<p>Dr. Michael Siegel, a Tufts University public health and community medicine professor, said the cancer connection should be the main takeaway from the new report.</p>



<p>“Essentially, what this means is that alcohol is clearly a carcinogen,” Siegel said. “There isn’t a level of moderate or light drinking that can be recommended to people, because at that level it will increase their cancer risk.”</p>



<p>Dr. Michael Pignone, a professor of medicine at Duke University, said that he hasn’t seen enough evidence to tell people to stop drinking but that they shouldn’t start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am skeptical that low levels of alcohol consumption really reduce mortality or cardiovascular mortality,” Pignone said. “I would not recommend someone start drinking for health benefits.”</p>



<p>A second report conducted by a group within the Department of Health and Human Services to be published in the coming weeks will also help inform the 2025 guidelines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think this report sort of highlights all the things that we don’t know,” said Dr. Nicholas Lim, a hepatologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School, adding he hopes it will prompt better research to clarify understanding of alcohol and health.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/fda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Food and Drug Administration </a>is changing the way <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-healthy-food-packaging-ruling-rcna184534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">food companies</a> can claim their products are &#8220;healthy.&#8221; Fortified white bread is out, and fatty fish like salmon is in.</p>



<p>Most everything in the grocer’s produce section — whole fruits and vegetables — would qualify under the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-food-labeling-and-critical-foods/use-term-healthy-food-labeling" target="_blank">new rule issued Thursday</a>. Other nutrient-rich foods, such as whole grains, dairy, eggs, beans, lentils, seafood, lean meat, nuts and seeds also pass the test as long as they have limited added sugar, salt and saturated fat.</p>



<p>Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables are included in the new &#8220;healthy&#8221; category.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an attempt to help shoppers in other aisles confused by nutrition fact labels that don’t give any real-world guidance as to whether one product is better than another.<strong></strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Now, people will be able to look for the ‘healthy’ claim to help them find foundational, nutritious foods for themselves and their families,&#8221; FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, wrote in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-updates-healthy-claim-providing-refreshed-tool-consumers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media statement</a>.</p>



<p>Nutrition experts were largely encouraged by the change.</p>



<p>“It’s a terrific advance,” said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. “For the first time, FDA will be judging foods not based on a handful of negative nutrients like calories or fat or salt, but on whether the food has healthy ingredients.”</p>



<p>The previous rule set in 1994 had a cap on total fat, which excluded products with heart-healthy fat, such as avocados. Products could also qualify if they had at least 10% of the daily value for certain vitamins, calcium, iron, protein or fiber.</p>



<p>Manufacturers found a loophole.</p>



<p>“That led companies to fortify junk food and call them healthy,” Mozaffarian said. Fruit juice could be labeled as “healthy” if they had enough vitamin C, for example, despite a tremendous amount of added sugar.</p>



<p>The new regulation eliminates that criteria. Products that can no longer claim to be healthy include fortified white bread and highly sweetened yogurts and cereals.</p>



<p>It’s one of the final moves from the Biden administration, and one that’s likely to be embraced by the incoming Trump administration.</p>



<p>The president-elect’s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has repeatedly said that replacing ultraprocessed food with healthier alternatives should be a priority to reduce chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes.</p>



<p>The changes won&#8217;t happen overnight. The FDA has given companies until 2028 to comply.</p>



<p>Still, shifting away from that nutrient-centric approach is good for consumers, experts said.</p>



<p>The idea reminds Elisabetta Politi, a dietitian at the Duke Lifestyle and Weight Management Center in Durham, North Carolina, of growing up in Italy where meals were considered &#8220;sacred.&#8221;</p>



<p>Quality of food mattered more than the number of carbs in a pasta dish, for example, she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;When we fix dinner, we don’t think of carbohydrates and fat. We think of broccoli and chicken, maybe quinoa,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s so much more relatable.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How is &#8216;healthy&#8217; defined?</h2>



<p>One impetus for changing how &#8220;healthy&#8221; is defined occurred in 2015, when the FDA sent a warning letter to the makers of Kind fruit and nut snack bars. The company, the FDA said, couldn&#8217;t claim their bars were healthy because they contained too many calories and saturated fat.</p>



<p>The company pushed back, saying those calories and fat content were because of the nuts in their products, which have proven benefits because of their higher levels of heart-healthy fat.</p>



<p>The FDA agreed, and started the process to update what &#8220;healthy&#8221; should mean on food labels.</p>



<p>Nearly a decade later, the FDA now says the updated &#8220;healthy&#8221; rule is in line with current U.S. dietary guidelines and &#8220;include a focus on the importance of healthy dietary patterns and the food groups that comprise them, the type of fat in the diet rather than the total amount of fat consumed, and the amount of sodium and added sugars in the diet.&#8221;</p>



<p>The FDA is also working on a healthy symbol that companies can add to packaging. Nutrition labels currently in use have not been shown to make a difference in consumers’ awareness of nutrition or how well they eat. The agency says that 75% of Americans lack adequate levels of fruit and vegetables in their diet.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The updated definition should give consumers more confidence when they see the ‘healthy’ claim while grocery shopping,&#8221; Nancy Brown, chief executive of the American Heart Association, said in a statement. &#8220;And hope it will motivate food manufacturers to develop new, healthier products that qualify to use the &#8216;healthy&#8217; claim.&#8221;</p>



<p>Brown also encouraged the FDA to move forward with another rule that would put key nutritional information on the front of packages.</p>



<p>And some experts worried that people might rely too much on a new &#8220;healthy&#8221; label from the FDA.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dietary needs are specific to each individual,&#8221; said Fran Fleming-Milici, director of marketing initiatives at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy &amp; Health. &#8220;A &#8216;healthy&#8217; claim on a package may actually prevent consumers from looking further into the nutritional content and other ingredients that may not be right for them.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Health officials on Wednesday confirmed the first known severe illness in the U.S. caused by bird flu, and California&#8217;s governor declared a state of emergency as the virus rampages through dairy cattle in that state.</p>



<p>A person in <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/louisiana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Louisiana</a> is hospitalized in critical condition with severe respiratory symptoms caused by a bird flu infection, state health officials said. The person, who is over 65 and has underlying medical problems, had been in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the first human case in the U.S. linked to exposure to backyard birds, according to the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>

<p>Since March, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 60</a> bird flu infections in people have been reported in the U.S., but previous illnesses have been mild and most have been detected among farmworkers exposed to sick poultry or dairy cows. In two cases — and adult in Missouri and a child in California — health officials have not determined how they caught it.</p>



<p>CDC officials said that bird flu is still mainly an animal health issues and that the risk to the general public remains low. There has been no documented spread of the virus from person to person, said the CDC&#8217;s Dr. Demetre Daskalakis.</p>



<p>The Louisiana illness comes weeks after Canadian officials reported that a teen in British Columbia was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu. In both instances, the illnesses were caused by a strain of the virus found in wild birds, not in cattle, officials said.</p>







<p>On a call with reporters, CDC officials did not answer a question about whether the new U.S. case and the Canada case had any similarities or differences.</p>



<p>In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared the state of emergency as cases of the virus were detected in dairy cows on Southern California farms. Previously, the virus had been detected in state's Central Valley.</p>



<p>“This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,” Newsom said in a statement.</p>



<p>The virus has been detected in 865 dairy herds in 16 states, with nearly 650 of them in California. Raw milk from infected cattle was recalled late last month after the virus was found in samples sold in California stores.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Los Angeles County health officials confirmed the deaths of two cats from bird flu infections after drinking the recalled raw milk.</p>



<p>Flu experts said the trajectory of the virus in people remains unclear, but they urged people who have contact with sick or dead birds to take precautions, including wearing respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry.</p>



<p>“We may see more cases of severe disease in the U.S. since cases seem to be growing more frequent,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Women should have the option of taking their own test samples for cervical cancer screening, an influential health panel said Tuesday.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Draft recommendations</a> from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are aimed at getting more people screened and spreading the word that women can take their own vaginal samples to check for cancer-causing HPV.</p>



<p>Women in their 20s should still get a Pap test every three years. But after that — from age 30 to 65 — women can get an HPV test every five years, the panel said. </p>



<p>And those HPV tests can be done with samples collected either by a doctor or by the patient herself in a mobile clinic or medical office. Women ages 30 to 65 can still opt for a Pap test done by a doctor every three years, or a Pap plus an HPV test every five years.</p>



<p>“I’m very hopeful that self-collection will help even more women get screened and help us reduce even further the burden of cervical cancer among women,” said task force vice chair Dr. John Wong of Tufts University School of Medicine.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, U.S. regulators <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-hpv-test-self-collection-health-care-setting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expanded the use of two HPV test kits</a> to include self-collection. Studies show women and doctors take samples with similar accuracy.</p>

<p>For now, the tests are only for use in health care settings; home testing may be on the horizon.</p>



<p>HPV, or human papillomavirus, is very common and is spread through sex. Most HPV infections clear up on their own, but persistent infection can lead to cancer of the cervix. Most cervical cancers occur in women who are inadequately screened, diagnosed or treated. </p>



<p>To collect a sample, a swab or brush from the kit is inserted into the vagina and rotated. It is put in a tube and processed at a lab.</p>



<p>The HPV tests detect high-risk types of the virus. In contrast, a Pap test looks for abnormal cells in the cervix.</p>



<p>Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden already use self-collection for cervical cancer screening.</p>



<p>Deaths from cervical cancers have declined in the U.S. in the past decade, and there is an HPV vaccine recommended for preteens that is preventing cancer in women and men. Still, nearly 14,000 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed in the U.S. this year and there were an estimated 4,360 deaths. </p>



<p>Black women, Native American women and Hispanic women still have higher death rates compared to white women. Women living in isolated areas also have higher than average death rates.</p>



<p>For many women, transgender men and nonbinary people, collecting their own sample could be more comfortable than the stirrups and speculum used by a doctor.</p>



<p>The draft advice remains largely the same as the group&#8217;s <a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous recommendations from 2018</a>. For example, women younger than 21 don&#8217;t need to be screened for cervical cancer. Neither do women older than 65 who&#8217;ve had regular screenings with normal results. And women of any age who&#8217;ve had a total hysterectomy don&#8217;t need to be screened.</p>



<p>The recommendations are open for comment through Jan. 13.</p>

<p>As cold and flu season begins, you may be wondering what you can do to help keep your immune system strong with all the nasty bugs going around.</p>



<p>In addition to staying up to date on your seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines, adopting healthy lifestyle habits can help strengthen your immune system naturally. These include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, managing stress and, of course, eating healthy.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no magic pill to give you immunity superpowers, but there are certain foods rich in nutrients that help support immune function and other bodily processes to say healthy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can food strengthen the immune system?</h2>



<p>The immune system is your body’s built-in defense system to help protect against disease and infection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This network of white blood cells, organs, chemicals, and proteins work together recognize and fight off harmful invaders —&nbsp;including bacteria, viruses, parasites or cancer cells —&nbsp;and help the body recover from infections or injuries,&nbsp;<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21196-immune-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per the Cleveland Clinic</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the time, our immune system does a good job on its own. Vaccines can build up our immunity to specific diseases, and you can support overall immune function by maintaining a healthy lifestyle —&nbsp;a main pillar of this is eating a nutritious, balanced diet.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/foods-to-boost-immune-system-rcna153786" target="_blank">best diet to promote a healthy immune system</a>&nbsp;is about 75% plant-based and provides nutrients the body needs to keep up its defenses, TODAY.com previously reported. These include protein, fiber and micronutrients like vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top immune-boosting snacks</h2>



<p>&#8220;Vitamin C and zinc are well-known for their contributions to the immune system, but many other nutrients play a role, as well,&#8221; says Natalie Rizzo, TODAY.com nutrition editor and registered dietitian.&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019735/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research shows</a>&nbsp;that vitamins A, E, D and B, folate, iron, copper and selenium also contribute to immune health, Rizzo adds.</p>



<p>These nutrients can help your immune system function properly so that you recover faster when you do catch an illness, says Rizzo. However, it&#8217;s important to note that diet alone will not prevent illness. &#8220;People think that if they just eat enough of a certain nutrient, they will never get sick. That’s not the case,&#8221; Rizzo says.</p>



<p>Even if the immune system is working well, disease-causing germs can still slip through. “If you touch the germs for a highly contagious illness, like norovirus, and then touch your face, no amount of vitamin C or zinc is going to stop you from getting it,” Rizzo notes.</p>



<p>However, it is still important to eat a variety of foods with nutrients to strengthen the immune system. Maintaining a healthy weight is also important for immune function,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-weight-growth/about/enhancing-immunity.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you&#8217;re reaching for a snack, consider these quick and easy foods with immune-boosting properties instead of less nutritious, highly processed snacks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Strawberries</h3>



<p>Strawberries are a favorite immune-boosting snack for Rizzo. The flavorful &#8220;super fruit&#8221; are sweet, delicious and tiny nutritional powerhouses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Arguably the most important nutrient for immunity is vitamin C, and many people don’t realize that berries are an excellent source of vitamin C,&#8221; says Rizzo. One serving, which is about eight fresh strawberries or one cup sliced, provides about 100% of your daily value of vitamin C, Rizzo adds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The antioxidants in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-many-calories-in-a-strawberry-rcna55690" target="_blank">strawberries</a>, such as anthocyanin and ellagic acid, can also support heart health and may help decrease inflammation in the body, TODAY.com previously reported.</p>



<p>Although technically not in season during the fall and winter in the U.S., fresh and frozen strawberries are still available at stores year-round. Strawberries can be enjoyed on their own — green tops and all — or eaten on top of greek&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-yogurt-rcna145315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yogurt</a>&nbsp;and oatmeal, or blended into smoothies.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t like strawberries, raspberries and blueberries are also rich in vitamin C and great options. Here are three more immune-boosting snacks Rizzo recommends:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Red bell peppers</strong></h3>



<p>Red bell peppers are another favorite immune-boosting snack that Rizzo recommends. Naturally low in calories and fat, red bell peppers provide fiber (about 2.5 grams per serving) and important micronutrients.</p>



<p>One serving of raw red bell pepper, or about a half-cup, provides over 100% of your daily value of vitamin C. Red bell peppers are also rich in vitamin A, which supports healthy vision and immune function. They also provide B vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, which can help support heart and brain health and lower inflammation.</p>



<p>Red bell peppers are usually affordable and easily accessible, and can be sliced for an easy snack on the go. &#8220;Dip them in hummus or tzatziki for a filling snack,&#8221; says Rizzo.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Oranges</h3>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/calories-in-an-orange-rcna57154" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">orange fruit</a>&nbsp;is a classic immune-boosting snack. &#8220;All varieties of oranges and 100% orange juice are excellent sources of vitamin C,&#8221; says Rizzo.</p>



<p>In addition to their high vitamin C content, oranges are a good source of fiber, potassium, folate and calcium, TODAY.com previously reported. Oranges contain the antioxidant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hesperidin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hesperidin</a>, which can suppress inflammation and is linked to immune health, heart health, cognitive function and more.</p>



<p>Oranges also have a high water content, which makes them an excellent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/food/12-best-summer-foods-debloat-boost-hydration-today-t224978" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hydrating snack</a>. Oranges are portable and easy to take and peel on the go. If you drink orange juice, make sure it&#8217;s fresh-squeezed 100% juice with no added sugar or preservatives.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pumpkin seeds</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a convenient immune-boosting snack,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/pumpkin-seeds-benefits-rcna121820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pumpkin seeds</a>, or pepitas, are an excellent option, according to Rizzo.</p>



<p>Pumpkin seeds are very nutrient-dense, providing plant-based protein and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as many vitamins and minerals that are important for healthy immune function. &#8220;One ounce of pumpkin seeds has 20% the daily value of zinc, another nutrient that helps you fight off a cold,&#8221; says Rizzo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pumpkin seeds are also rich in vitamin E, potassium, magnesium, iron and calcium, TODAY.com previously reported. These can help support a healthy metabolism, gut health, brain health and more.</p>



<p>Enjoy roasted pumpkin seeds on their own or on top of yogurt, soups, or blended into sauces.&nbsp;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="http://tag/fda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food and Drug Administration</a> may finally move to ban artificial red food dye, the coloring found in beverages, snacks, cereals and candies.</p>



<p>At the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee meeting Thursday, Jim Jones, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for human foods, said it’s been over a decade since the safety of the synthetic color additive Red No. 40 has been re-evaluated. “With Red 3, we have&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fda.gov/industry/color-additives/fdc-red-no-3" target="_blank">a petition in front of us</a>&nbsp;to revoke the authorization board, and we’re hopeful that in the next few weeks we’ll be acting on that petition,” he said.</p>



<p>House Energy and Commerce Committee ranking member Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., also&nbsp;<a href="https://democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/media/press-releases/pallone-calls-fda-ban-red-dye-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urged the FDA</a>&nbsp;to ban Red No. 3, which is made from petroleum and gives food and drinks a bright cherry color.</p>



<p>“With the holiday season in full swing where sweet treats are abundant, it is frightening that this chemical remains hidden in these foods that we and our children are eating,” Pallone wrote in a letter to the agency. “While food companies must ensure that the food they market is safe, they are also only required to ensure that their products meet FDA’s standards. This means that thousands of products that contain this chemical can remain on the market.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for health secretary, has claimed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jrs-no-1-hurdle-take-unhealthy-food-money-rcna180365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">food dyes cause cancer</a>, but has not said what he would do if confirmed to the Cabinet post — if anything — about artificial food dyes in American food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There are some departments such as the nutrition departments in the FDA that have to go, that are not doing their job, they are not protecting our kids,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/rfk-jr-starts-fleshing-vision-trumps-second-term-rcna179000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kennedy told NBC News&nbsp;</a>in November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FDA regulates more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/economics-staff/fda-glance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three-quarters</a>&nbsp;of the United States’ food supply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All color additives must be approved by the FDA before they are used in food sold in the U.S. There are 36 FDA-approved color additives,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/color-additives-information-consumers/color-additives-questions-and-answers-consumers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nine of which</a>&nbsp;are synthetic dyes. This includes the two red dyes facing federal scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the same dyes that are used in food are also used in pharmaceutical drugs, but the dyes are approved separately for each use. In 1990, the FDA banned Red No. 3, also known as erythrosine, from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/industry/color-additives/fdc-red-no-3#:~:text=In%201990%2C%20based%20on%20the,is%20associated%20with%20animal%20carcinogenicity." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cosmetics and topical drugs</a>&nbsp;under the Delaney Clause, because the chemical was shown to be carcinogenic at high doses in tests on lab rats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t believe there is a risk to humans,” FDA’s Jones said.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.nbcnews.com/news/embedded-video/mmvo225650757613' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>



<p>Some of the dyes allowed in food in the United States are either banned or require a warning label in other countries. The European Union&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:354:0016:0033:en:PDF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requires a warning label</a>&nbsp;on products that contain three artificial food dyes approved in the U.S.:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Yellow No. 5, also known as tartrazine.</li>



<li>Red No. 40, also called E129 or Allura Red AC.</li>



<li>Yellow No. 6, called sunset yellow or E110.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The required label warns that the additive “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.”</p>



<p>“There is something called the precautionary principle, which is basically the thought that it’s better to be safe than sorry,&#8221; said Jerold Mande, an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who is also a former FDA senior adviser and former deputy undersecretary for food safety at the Agriculture Department.&nbsp;“The U.S. wears it as a badge of honor that we don’t adhere to it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other countries do not want to take a risk, even if data on potential harms is not conclusive, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These food dyes only serve one function in food, to make them look pretty so you and I want to buy it, it’s a marketing tool,” said Thomas Galligan, principal scientist for food additives and supplements at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the science says about artificial food dyes</strong></h2>



<p>Some experts and consumer advocacy groups argue there is enough evidence showing some color additives may cause harm, particularly in children, to warrant a ban, but the FDA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/color-additives-information-consumers/color-additives-questions-and-answers-consumers#:~:text=avoid%20color%20additives%3F-,Color%20additives%20are%20safe%20when%20they%20are%20used%20in%20accordance,ingredients%20on%20the%20nutrition%20label." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintains</a>&nbsp;that its approved artificial food dyes are safe when used in accordance with the agency’s recommendations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An FDA advisory committee conducted a review of the possible link between artificial food dyes and hyperactivity&nbsp;<a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/org-1137/20170406211659/https:/www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/FoodAdvisoryCommittee/UCM248549.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2011</a>&nbsp;and determined that “a causal relationship between exposure to color additives and hyperactivity in children in the general population has not been established.” The agency revisited the issue in 2019 and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/october-7-2019-science-board-fda-meeting-announcement-10072019-10072019#event-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintained</a>&nbsp;its stance. Regulatory agencies and scientists alike have reached conflicting conclusions about what research has found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The most concerning is that we do so little science to understand the harms,” Mande said, referring to research funded by the U.S. government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a 2012&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3441937/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of studies</a>&nbsp;on artificial food dyes and ADHD symptoms, which included the research presented to the FDA in 2011, researchers concluded that artificial food colorings “are not a main cause of ADHD, but they may contribute significantly to some cases, and in some cases may additively push a youngster over the diagnostic threshold.”</p>



<p>The researchers also said that three landmark placebo-controlled&nbsp;<a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(07)61306-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a>&nbsp;conducted in children in the U.K., which have been cited as reason for banning or restricting the use of artificial dyes, “were barely sufficient to detect the statistically small but clinically important effects noted.”</p>



<p>The European Food Safety Authority also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/news/efsa-evaluates-southampton-study-food-additives-and-child-behaviour" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concluded</a>&nbsp;in 2008 that the findings showed “a lack of consistency.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than a decade later, officials completed the&nbsp;<a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/risk-assessment/synthetic-food-dye-risk-assessment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment</a>, a 2021 review of all the available research that studied whether artificial food dyes may have an effect on human health. The conclusion: “Consumption of synthetic food dyes can result in hyperactivity and other neurobehavioral problems in some children, and that children vary in their sensitivity to synthetic food dyes.”</p>



<p>“The evidence now shows pretty conclusively that when some kids eat these, they will experience nervous system effects that look like ADHD,” Galligan said. “There are 27 human clinical trials that show these dyes do in fact harm children’s behavior.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the U.S. differs from Europe</h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fda.gov/industry/color-additives/summary-color-additives-use-united-states-foods-drugs-cosmetics-and-medical-devices#table1B" target="_blank">Red No. 40 was approved in 1971</a>&nbsp;and Red No. 3 and Yellow No. 5 were approved in 1969. At the time, the safety trials were conducted in animals, not people. Researchers have since tested safety in a mix of animal studies and a few placebo-controlled trials in children. “We really don’t have the science we should have so these things are a little unclear, but these dyes and behavioral issues, there is an established connection,” Harvard’s Mande said.</p>



<p>The government spends&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jrs-no-1-hurdle-take-unhealthy-food-money-rcna180365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very little money</a>&nbsp;researching synthetic food additives once they are approved, Mande said.&nbsp;<a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH-Nutrition-Research-Report-Executive-Summary-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Less than 5%</a>&nbsp;of the National Institutes of Health’s research budget goes to studying issues related to nutrition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Acute harms, such as poisoning, are well understood among FDA-approved products, Mande said, “but the effort to understand the effects in the long term or subtle things like behavior, we don’t study that.”</p>

<p>The FDA lacks a formal way to review substances that are already in the food supply — known as a post-market review — which could allow unsafe additives to linger in the food system even as new research becomes available, said Jennifer Pomeranz, an associate professor of public health policy and management at the New York University School of Global Public Health.</p>



<p>“Even when there is an enormous amount of data, it can take decades to remove something that might be harmful from the food system,” she said. “The FDA clearly needs more resources for post-market research because of these additives that have been in the food system for so long without any post-market review.”</p>



<p>This lack of follow-up sets the U.S. apart from Europe, Jones said at Thursday’s committee meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The biggest distinction between the U.S. and Europe is that they have been doing post-market review of chemicals for over 20 years,” he said. “The FDA, although we have authorization to do post-market review, there’s no statutory mandate.”</p>



<p>That may change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September, the FDA held a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/hfp-constituent-updates/fda-hold-public-meeting-development-enhanced-systematic-process-fdas-post-market-assessment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public meeting</a>&nbsp;about proposed enhancements to re-evaluating chemicals that have been approved for use in food, including color additives. The agency also extended the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/11/21/2024-27289/development-of-an-enhanced-systematic-process-for-the-food-and-drug-administrations-post-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public comment period</a>&nbsp;to late January 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An FDA spokesperson said in an email that the food dyes it has approved are reviewed by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In addition to evaluations and review by the FDA, the FDA supports and participates in the international risk assessments conducted under JECFA as a part of our post-market activities to ensure safety of substances added to food,” the spokesperson said. “All the colors listed have recently undergone assessments for safety in food by the JECFA and were found to be safe for use in food under current use conditions.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>States already banning the artificial food dyes</strong></h2>



<p>States are already putting pressure on manufacturers to remove artificial dyes from food and beverages. In the last year, three states have introduced or passed legislation banning certain color additives.</p>



<p>In October 2023, legislators passed the&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB2316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California School Food Safety Act</a>. The law&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-governor-signs-legislation-prohibiting-six-artificial-dyes-rcna173232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will ban</a>&nbsp;six of the nine FDA-approved artificial food dyes –– Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2 and Green No. 3 –– in public school food and drinks by 2027.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April, Illinois lawmakers advanced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=2637&amp;GAID=17&amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;SessionID=112&amp;GA=103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legislation</a>&nbsp;that would ban Red No. 3 in the state by 2028.&nbsp;</p>



<p>New York legislators introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://legiscan.com/NY/bill/A09293/2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bill</a>&nbsp;in February that would ban Red No. 3 in food and drinks in the state beginning in 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The moves, particularly in California, could push food manufacturers to remove the dyes from food nationwide, Mande said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These food dyes are things that a lot of countries already don’t allow. It’s one thing to produce different foods for different countries, but to do it for different states is a nonstarter,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some food manufacturers have already removed artificial dyes from their products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After years of pressure from the public, Kraft voluntarily&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/kraft-mac-cheese-says-goodbye-dye-n345006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed synthetic dyes</a>&nbsp;from its macaroni and cheese in 2015, replacing Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6 with natural coloring. That same year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nestleusa.com/media/pressreleases/removing-artificial-flavors-and-fda-certified-colors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nestlé removed</a>&nbsp;Red No. 40 and Yellow No. 5 from over 250 products, including candy bars.</p>



<p>A ban on the federal level would be relatively simple, Center for Science in the Public Interest’s Galligan said: “They just have to make the decision that it no longer meets the safety standard and issue a decision that it is no longer allowed in food.”</p>



<p>An FDA spokesperson told NBC News that it has reviewed the studies cited by California lawmakers in the California School Food Safety Act.</p>



<p>“The totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives, but some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them,” the spokesperson said in an email.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Cold and flu season always comes around when the weather starts to change. But does cold, wet weather actually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/why-do-i-keep-getting-colds-rcna48315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make you sick</a>? Not really, experts say. But cooler temperatures and dry winter air can affect your body in surprising ways.</p>



<p>As the weather starts to turn, rates of certain respiratory illnesses start to tick up. Beginning in September and October, we might start to see more cases of rhinovirus (a frequent cause of the common cold) and influenza, Ellen Foxman, Ph.D., associate professor of laboratory medicine and immunobiology at the Yale School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com.</p>



<p>Early in the fall, experts might also see more cases of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/rsv-surge-2022-rcna57298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">respiratory syncytial virus</a>, Dr. Geeta Sood, assistant professor of medicine and epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, tells TODAY.com.</p>



<p>With COVID-19 in the mix, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/tripledemic-2023-covid-rsv-flu-rcna96006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dynamics of respiratory virus season</a>&nbsp;have changed in the last few years, Sood says.</p>



<p>The seasonal flu usually causes a sharp rise in cases with a peak that lasts around two to three weeks, Foxman explains. &#8220;That&#8217;s usually somewhere between Nov. 1 and March 1, but it&#8217;s hard to predict exactly when,&#8221; she adds.</p>



<p>Right now, flu rates in the U.S. are just starting to rise, Foxman says, so the peak may come sometime in December this year.</p>



<p>In general, illnesses like these all tend to have a wave in the fall and winter &#8220;because many of the same risk factors for influenza and RSV are also the same risk factors for COVID-19 infection,&#8221; Sood explains.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Does cold, wet weather make you sick?</h2>



<p>No. Cold or wet weather on its own doesn&#8217;t cause a cold and won&#8217;t make you sick, the experts say.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Can cold weather make you more likely to get sick?</h2>



<p>It is true that respiratory viral illnesses tend to spike in the cooler months, Foxman says. But if the cold doesn&#8217;t cause illnesses directly, what&#8217;s causing the connection between cool weather and colds?</p>



<p>First, the cold winter air may actually make it easier for viruses to spread. &#8220;It&#8217;s thought that the cooler, drier air helps (viruses like flu and SARS-CoV-2) transmit better from person to person,&#8221; Foxman says.</p>



<p>And her&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4311828/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous work</a>&nbsp;suggests that &#8220;changes in the ambient temperature (can affect) your body&#8217;s ability to fight viruses,&#8221; she explains. That research shows that even small changes in the temperature of your airways can negatively impact the tissues that line those airways, which typically act as the body&#8217;s first line of defense against respiratory pathogens.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you happen to have a virus in your airway, having the lining of the airway be a slightly cooler temperature can promote the virus&#8217;s ability to replicate because your body can&#8217;t fight it off as well,&#8221; Foxman explains.</p>



<p>There are also indirect factors to consider here as well, Sood says.</p>



<p>For instance, it&#8217;s during these cooler months that school starts and we tend to travel and gather indoors with friends and family. Behaviors like these —&nbsp;especially when they&#8217;re happening in confined spaces with little air flow —&nbsp;encourage viruses to spread, she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Can cold weather make you <em>feel</em> sick?</h2>



<p>Even if you&#8217;re not actually sick, there some very understandable reasons that the changing of seasons can make you feel a little off.</p>



<p>For instance, shorter daylight hours have an&nbsp;&#8220;impact on people&#8217;s mental health and energy levels,&#8221; Sood explains, and that can make you feel &#8220;run down.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some people also experience fall allergies and have greater exposure to indoor allergens like pet dander and dust mites this time of year, Dr. Zachary Rubin, an allergist with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oakbrookallergists.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oak Brook Allergists</a>&nbsp;and spokesperson for the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, told TODAY.com previously.</p>



<p>Fall allergies can cause similar symptoms to a common cold, such as congestion, post-nasal drip and fatigue, Rubin said.</p>



<p>Others also experience a condition called nonallergic rhinitis, a condition that causes allergy-like symptoms —&nbsp;stuffy, runny nose, for instance —&nbsp;that aren&#8217;t related to allergies. Changes in temperature or humidity are common causes of nonallergic rhinitis, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nonallergic-rhinitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;says.</p>



<p>For some, weather changes can &#8220;create extra inflammation for people,&#8221; Rubin said, which can cause us to feel out of whack and exacerbate allergy symptoms. “Think of it like your body has a set point that it’s used to,” he explained, “and when we have these dramatic changes, that could potentially (affect) how your immune system responds.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How to stay healthy when the weather gets cold</h2>



<p>Knowing that respiratory illnesses are circulating when the weather cools off, it makes sense to take some extra steps to keep yourself healthy —&nbsp;especially this time of year.</p>



<p>First off, consider getting vaccinated, Sood says. There are vaccines available to protect&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/covid-booster-fall-2024-rcna167747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">against COVID-19</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/best-time-get-flu-shot-rcna47541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seasonal flu</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/news/fda-approves-worlds-first-rsv-vaccine-shot-adults-ages-60-rcna82697" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now RSV</a>&nbsp;(for older adults) as well. &#8220;Vaccinations are truly miraculous in terms of preventing severe disease and, in some cases, any disease,&#8221; Sood says.</p>



<p>Additionally, masking is still an effective way to protect yourself during the respiratory virus season, the experts say. And it&#8217;s a really good idea to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/covid-masks-2024-rcna132920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mask up during busy holiday travel</a>, like plane rides, Sood says.</p>



<p>Wearing a mask or scarf over your face when outside in cold weather can also help &#8220;humidify your airway,&#8221; Foxman says. &#8220;The air you&#8217;re exhaling is warm and humid from inside your body,&#8221; she explains, &#8220;and if you have a scarf or a mask over your nose and mouth, you&#8217;re holding that warmth and humidity in your upper airway as you&#8217;re breathing out.&#8221;</p>



<p>Knowing that viruses may be more able to infect you if your airways are cool and dry, this strategy may help bolster your body&#8217;s protection against those viruses.</p>



<p>At holiday gatherings, &#8220;make sure that you have as much circulation of good, clean air as possible,&#8221; Sood adds, &#8220;so that even if you are around someone who&#8217;s infected, it&#8217;s less likely to spread.&#8221; You can encourage better air quality by using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/shop/how-shop-air-purifier-t191867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HEPA filters</a>&nbsp;and, if weather allows, opening some windows.</p>



<p>Consider taking an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/covid-testing-holidays-rcna56419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at-home COVID-19 test before attending a gathering</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;especially if you develop any symptoms that could indicate an infection.</p>



<p>And don&#8217;t forget about basic self-care practices to boost your immune system, Foxman says. That includes getting good quality sleep, staying physically active, managing stress and eating a balanced diet&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-snack-boost-immune-system-rcna182453" target="_blank">full of immune-boosting foods, like fruits and vegetables</a>.</p>



<p><em>Even if cold, wet weather doesn&#8217;t directly cause a cold, take the change in seasons as a reminder that respiratory illnesses are likely to be circulating right now —&nbsp;and you have tools available to keep yourself and your community safe.</em></p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Exposure to lead in gasoline during childhood resulted in many millions of excess cases of psychiatric disorders over the last 75 years, a new study estimates.</p>



<p>Lead was banned from automobile fuel in 1996. The study, published Wednesday in&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcpp.14072" target="_blank">the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry</a>, looked at its lasting impact in the U.S. by analyzing childhood blood lead levels from 1940 to 2015. According to the findings, the national population experienced an estimated 151 million excess mental health disorders attributable to exposure to lead from car exhaust during children’s early development.</p>



<p>The exposure made generations of Americans more depressed, anxious, inattentive or hyperactive, the study says.</p>



<p>The researchers — a group from Duke University, Florida State University and the Medical University of South Carolina — found that the exposure also lowered people’s capacity for impulse control and made them more inclined to be neurotic.</p>



<p>Lead-associated mental health and personality differences were most pronounced for people born between 1966 and 1986, according to the study. Of that group, the greatest lead-linked mental illness burden was for Generation Xers born between 1966 and 1970, coinciding with peak use of leaded gasoline in the mid-1960s and mid-1970s.</p>



<p>People born during those years “can’t go back in time and change that,” said Aaron Reuben, a co-author of the study and a postdoctoral scholar in neuropsychology at Duke and the Medical University of South Carolina.</p>



<p>“Studies like ours today add more evidence that removing lead from our environment and not putting it there in the first place has more benefits than we previously understood,” Reuben said.</p>



<p>The groups born around 1940 and 2015 had the lowest lead exposure and lead-associated mental illness, the study reported.</p>



<p>Though no longer in gasoline, lead is still present in other sources, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/prevention/consumer-products.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some toys imported from other countries</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/syracuse-residents-activists-demand-action-lead-water-rcna180390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water service lines</a>&nbsp;that have not yet been updated, some soil and paint in old houses. (Lead paint was banned in 1978.)</p>



<p>There is no safe level of exposure to lead,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/communication-resources/know-the-facts.html" target="_blank">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Even small amounts are associated with developmental and learning difficulties,&nbsp;given that lead exposure is known to harm the brain and the nervous and reproductive systems. Children under 6 years old are most vulnerable to lead poisoning.</p>



<p>The study published Wednesday combined data on blood lead levels and estimates of historical lead exposure with findings from past studies, including a 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2720691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study of nearly 600 New Zealand residents</a>&nbsp;that followed kids exposed to lead and measured their mental health over more than three decades.</p>



<p>Reuben, who was the lead author of that study, said the new research “doesn’t create new information about whether lead causes harm, nor do we say this is a study that proves causation —&nbsp;we’re really just taking existing evidence and applying it to the whole U.S. population.”</p>



<p>“We’re not at all concerned that we have in any way overestimated the harm,” he added.</p>



<p>Dr. Lisa Fortuna, chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s Council on Children, Adolescents and Their Families, praised the study.</p>



<p>“We don’t often get to see a lot of studies that look at environmental, or toxin-related, potential associated risks with the development of elevated rates of mental health problems in populations,” she said. “The research shed some light on the profound and lasting impact of environmental factors.”</p>



<p>The study’s findings should not be cause for panic, Fortuna said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It does not mean that people are, I would say, stuck with a mental illness. It doesn’t mean that they’re necessarily going to have a higher risk,” she said. “It’s really an issue of, ‘Here’s what’s happened at a population level.’”</p>



<p>The study comes a couple of years after Reuben and other researchers found that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/lead-gasoline-blunted-iq-half-us-population-study-rcna19028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exposure to leaded gasoline lowered the IQ of about half the U.S. population</a>. That study estimated that childhood exposure to lead from gasoline cost Americans about 824 million IQ points.</p>



<p>Lead was originally added to gasoline to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/gasoline/history-of-gasoline.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve engine performance</a>. Use of leaded gas increased after World War II until it proved damaging to catalytic converters, which became required in the 1970s. Some of lead’s hazards were known long before it was banned from gasoline, but reducing exposure to it did not become a federal priority for many years.</p>



<p>Lead screenings are now recommended for all young children, with treatment such as chelation therapy available to remove the poison if levels are high.</p>



<p>Reuben said prevention is the best way to keep people safe.</p>



<p>“We’ve done a lot of good in the U.S. reducing lead exposures. Blood lead levels have gone way down, but they could go down further,” he said. “I hope that we can learn from the history about how much harm we caused in the U.S., and try to apply that moving forward.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>It’s been called the closest the world has ever come to a vaccine against the AIDS virus.</p>



<p>The twice-yearly shot was 100% effective in preventing HIV infections in a study of women, and results published Wednesday show it worked nearly as well in men.</p>



<p>Drugmaker Gilead said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates — mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. But it has excluded nearly all of Latin America, where rates are far lower but increasing, sparking concern the world is missing a critical opportunity to stop the disease.</p>



<p>“This is so far superior to any other prevention method we have, that it’s unprecedented,” said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS. She credited Gilead for developing the drug, but said the world’s ability to stop AIDS hinges on its use in at-risk countries.</p>



<p>In a report issued to mark World AIDS Day on Sunday, UNAIDS said that the number of AIDS death last year — an estimated 630,000 — was at its lowest since peaking in 2004, suggesting the world is now at “a historic crossroads” and has a chance to end the epidemic. </p>



<p>The drug called lenacapavir is already sold under the brand name Sunlenca to treat HIV infections in the U.S., Canada, Europe and elsewhere. The company plans to seek authorization soon for Sunlenca to be used for HIV prevention.</p>



<p>While there are other ways to guard against infection, like condoms, daily pills, vaginal rings and bi-monthly shots, experts say the Gilead twice-yearly shots would be particularly useful for marginalized people often fearful of seeking care, including gay men, sex workers and young women. </p>



<p>“It would be a miracle for these groups because it means they just have to show up twice a year at a clinic and then they’re protected,” said UNAIDS’ Byanyima. </p>



<p>Such was the case for Luis Ruvalcaba, a 32-year-old man in Guadalajara, Mexico, who participated in the latest published study. He said he was afraid to ask for the daily prevention pills provided by the government, fearing he would be discriminated against as a gay man. Because he took part in the study, he&#8217;ll continue to receive the shots for at least another year.</p>



<p>“In Latin American countries, there is still a lot of stigma, patients are ashamed to ask for the pills,” said Dr. Alma Minerva Pérez, who recruited and enrolled a dozen study volunteers at a private research center in Guadalajara.</p>



<p>How widely available the shots will be in Mexico through the country&#8217;s health care system isn&#8217;t yet known. Health officials declined to comment on any plans to buy Sunlenca for its citizens; daily pills to prevent HIV were made freely available via the country’s public health system in 2021. </p>



<p>&#8220;If the possibility of using generics has opened, I have faith that Mexico can join,” said Pérez.</p>



<p>Byanyima said other countries besides Mexico that took part in the research were also excluded from the generics deal, including Brazil, Peru and Argentina. “To now deny them that drug is unconscionable.” she said.</p>



<p>In a statement, Gilead said it has “an ongoing commitment to helping enable access to HIV prevention and treatment options where the need is the greatest.” Among the 120 countries eligible for generic version are 18 mostly African countries that comprise 70% of the world’s HIV burden. </p>



<p> The drugmaker said it is also working on establishing “fast, efficient pathways to reach all people who need or want lenacapavir for HIV prevention.”</p>



<p>On Thursday, 15 advocacy groups in Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, Chile, Guatemala and Colombia wrote to Gilead, asking for generic Sunlenca to be made available in Latin America, citing the “alarming” inequity in access to new HIV prevention tools while infection rates were rising. </p>



<p>While countries including Norway, France, Spain and the U.S. have paid more than $40,000 per year for Sunlenca, experts have calculated it could be produced for as little as $40 per treatment once generic production expands to cover 10 million people. </p>



<p>Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University, said it will be enormously useful to have Sunlenca available in the hardest-hit countries in Africa and Asia. But he said the rising HIV rates among groups including gay men and transgender populations constituted “a public health emergency” in Latin America.</p>



<p>Hannya Danielle Torres, a 30-year-old trans woman and artist who was in the Sunlenca study in Mexico, said she hoped the government would find a way to provide the shots. “Mexico may have some of the richest people in the world but it also has some of the most vulnerable people living in extreme poverty and violence,” Torres said. </p>



<p>Another drugmaker, Viiv Healthcare, also left out most of Latin America when it allowed generics of its HIV prevention shot in about 90 countries. Sold as Apretude, the bi-monthly shots are about 80% to 90% effective in preventing HIV. They cost about $1,500 a year in middle-income countries, beyond what most can afford to pay.</p>



<p>Asia Russell, executive director of the advocacy group Health Gap, said that with more than 1 million new HIV infections globally every year, established prevention methods are not enough. She urged countries like Brazil and Mexico to issue “compulsory licenses,” a mechanism where countries suspend patents in a health crisis.</p>



<p>It’s a strategy some countries embraced for previous HIV treatments, including in the late 1990s and 2000s when AIDS drugs were first discovered. More recently, Colombia issued its first-ever compulsory license for the key HIV treatment Tivicay in April, without permission from its drugmaker, Viiv. </p>



<p>Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an AIDS expert at South Africa&#8217;s University of KwaZulu-Natal, said he had never seen a drug that appeared to be as effective as Sunlenca in preventing HIV. </p>



<p> “The missing piece in the puzzle now is how we get it to everyone who needs it,” he said.</p>

<p>The outgoing head of the nation’s top public health agency urged the next administration to maintain its focus and funding to keep Americans safe from emerging health threats.</p>



<p>“We need to continue to do our global work at CDC to make sure we are stopping outbreaks at their source,” Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/ceenters-for-disease-control-and-prevention"> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,</a> said in an interview Monday with The Associated Press. “We need to keep that funding up. We need to keep the expertise up. We need to keep the diplomacy up.”</p>



<p>Cohen, 46, will be leaving office in January after about 18 months in the job. President-elect <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/Donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> on Friday night <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/trump-administration">said he picked </a>Dave Weldon, a former Congressman from Florida, to be the agency’s next chief. </p>



<p>Cohen said she hasn’t met Weldon and doesn’t know him. She previously voiced concern about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/vaccines">anti-vaccine</a> advocate and CDC critic nominated to oversee all federal public health agencies.</p>

<p>The CDC, with a $9.2 billion core budget, is charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats. The staff is heavy with scientists — 60% have master’s degrees or doctorates.</p>



<p>The last eight years have been perhaps the most difficult in the agency&#8217;s history. The CDC once enjoyed a sterling international reputation for its expertise on infectious diseases and other causes of illness and death. But trust in the agency fell because of missteps during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, political attacks and resistance to infection-prevention measures like wearing masks and getting vaccinated.</p>



<p>The CDC has four political appointees, out of about 13,000 employees. The rest serve no matter who is in the White House, with civil service protections against efforts to fire them for political reasons.</p>



<p>Trump said during the campaign that he wants to convert many federal agency positions into political appointments, meaning those employees could be hired and fired by whoever wins the election. </p>



<p>There’s also a proposal to split the agency in two: one to track disease data, and another focused on public health but with a limited ability to make policy recommendations.</p>



<p>And then there’s a current budget proposal in Congress that would cut the agency’s funding by 22%. It would also eliminate the CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which works on topics like drownings, drug overdoses, suicides and and shooting deaths. </p>



<p>Cohen said there’s reason to be proud of the agency’s work in recent years. The CDC has built partnerships to improve the availability of testing for different infections and to watch for signs of disease outbreaks by monitoring wastewater. There are emerging threats, as always, but no new, full-fledged public health emergencies, she said.</p>

<p>The day after the Nov. 5 election, Cohen emailed CDC employees to urge them to keep going.</p>



<p>“While the world may feel different with changes ahead — our mission has not changed,” she wrote.</p>



<p>She said she’s not aware of any wave of worried CDC scientists heading for the doors because of the election results.</p>



<p>“There is a difference between campaigning and governing,” she said. “I want to go into this in a way that we’re passing the baton.”</p>



<p>Cohen said she doesn’t know what she’ll do next, other than spend time with her family in Raleigh, North Carolina, where her family maintained its residence while she ran the agency.</p>



<p>Next year, for the first time, the CDC director will be subject to Senate confirmation, which could make for a gap before Trump&#8217;s pick takes the helm. CDC Deputy Director Dr. Debra Houry has been assigned to help manage the transition.</p>



<p>Aside from administration transition, the CDC has to face several looming threats.</p>



<p>Officials this month confirmed the first U.S. case of a new form of mpox that was first seen in eastern Congo.</p>



<p>There’s also the ongoing stream of bird flu cases, most of them mild illnesses seen in farmworkers who were in direct contact with infected cows or chickens. CDC officials say they believe the risk to the public remains low and that there’s no evidence it’s been spreading between people.</p>



<p>“I don’t think we’re yet at a turning place. But does that mean it couldn’t change tomorrow? It could,” she said. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Ready or not, the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holidays are here</a>. It&#8217;s a time when many Americans accustomed to preparing simple meals find themselves responsible for safely serving multi-dish feasts.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no easy task. Outbreaks of some types of <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">food poisoning</a> tend to rise in November and December, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/clostridium-perfringens/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a> Tainted turkey, undercooked stuffing and germ-laced gravy from holiday buffets have all led to past illnesses — and even deaths — CDC investigators have found.</p>



<p>It can be tricky for occasional cooks to prepare big meals in a way that avoids the common hazards that can make people sick, said Donald Schaffner, a food science expert at Rutgers University.</p>



<p>“Cooking takes longer with big masses of food. Cooling takes longer with big masses of food,” said Schaffner, who co-hosts the food-safety podcast “Risky or Not?”</p>



<p>Together with podcast co-host Benjamin Chapman, a food scientist at North Carolina State University, Schaffner outlined common ways to keep holiday meals both festive and safe.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prepare the turkey</h2>



<p>Nearly 90% of U.S. hosts plan to serve turkey on Thanksgiving this year, according to the turkey producer Butterball.</p>



<p>But raw turkey can harbor illness-causing bacteria such as salmonella, campylobacter and other germs. It must be handled safely to prevent those bugs from contaminating refrigerator surfaces, sinks and kitchen counters.</p>



<p>A frozen bird must be thawed first. There are several accepted methods, including in the refrigerator, in the microwave or in cold running water, Schaffner said.</p>



<p>“All of these methods pose risks,” he cautioned.</p>



<p>A frozen turkey needs about 24 hours for every 4 to 5 pounds of weight to thaw in a refrigerator, according to the Agriculture Department. If you use a microwave or the cold water method, the bird must be cooked immediately. For details about safe turkey handling, check out the thawing and <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/poultry/happy-thanksgiving#Thawing_Calculator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cooking calculators created by the USDA. </a></p>



<p>And don’t wash the turkey. It’s a bad idea to rinse it in the sink, even though many cooks still insist on the practice, often out of habit, said Chapman.</p>



<p>“Anything that hits that surface and generates spray is going to basically spread contamination around your kitchen,” he said.</p>



<p>Instead, pat the turkey dry with paper towels and toss them, or use a kitchen towel and disinfect it in the laundry.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What about roasting? </h2>



<p>Turkey needs to reach a cooked temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit before serving. The best way to tell if it’s cooked is to use a tip-sensitive digital thermometer inserted in the innermost section of the thigh, not touching the bone.</p>



<p>Don’t rely on the plastic pop-up thermometers stuck in some commercial turkeys. Chapman’s past research shows that those buttons can activate well before the bird is actually done.</p>



<p>At the same time, don’t determine doneness by relying on signs such as golden-brown skin, whether the meat is no longer pink or whether the juices run clear. </p>



<p>“None of those are great indicators of temperature,” Chapman said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Side dishes and leftovers </h2>



<p>How you handle the rest of the meal — mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans or yams — is just as important as the main dish. It’s crucial to avoid the so-called danger zone of temperatures between 40 degrees and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, where bacteria can easily grow. </p>



<p>The key is to keep hot foods piping hot and cold foods cold — and to refrigerate everything promptly, Schaffner said.</p>



<p>“The recommendation is that you get those leftovers into the refrigerator within two hours of when they came off of the stove,” he said.</p>



<p>Make sure to refrigerate dense foods like sliced turkey, cooked sweet potatoes or gravy in shallow containers to help them cool down fast. Schaffner’s recent research showed that foods cooled in containers at a depth of no more than 2 inches posed little risk of growing dangerous germs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep it clean </h2>



<p>One key way to avoid food poisoning is through scrupulous cleaning in the kitchen. </p>



<p>Wash your hands before preparing food and after touching raw poultry. Use separate cutting boards, knives and other utensils when handling raw meat and fresh foods such as vegetables and salads. </p>



<p>Pay close attention to any surface that may be contaminated. It’s important to clean first with soap and water and then sanitize with a disinfectant — a two-step process.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A previously unidentified chemical has been discovered in the tap water of about one-third of U.S. homes,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk6749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new study has found</a>, and scientists are actively investigating whether it&#8217;s toxic.</p>



<p>The chemical, called chloronitramide anion, forms when &#8220;water is treated with chloramine, a chemical formed by mixing chlorine and ammonia. Chloramine is often used to kill viruses and bacteria in municipal water treatment systems,&#8221;&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/chemical-identified-drinking-water-chloramine-may-be-toxic-rcna181052" target="_blank">NBC News reported</a>.</p>



<p>About 40 years ago, researchers became aware of a chemical byproduct from water being treated with chloramine, but only with new testing have researchers been able to identify exactly what it is.</p>



<p>Chloronitramide anion has never been studied before, so it may be years before scientists are able to understand whether it&#8217;s dangerous to consume. The study was published to call attention to potential safety concerns and encourage additional research.</p>



<p>While there is currently no conclusive evidence to suggest chloronitramide anion is harmful to health, it has some resemblances to other &#8220;toxic molecules,&#8221; David Wahman, Ph.D., study author and research environmental engineer at the Environmental Protection Agency, told NBC News.</p>



<p>Part of the reason for the concern over the chemical&#8217;s potential toxicity is that it appears to be widespread in U.S. drinking water.</p>



<p>&#8220;We looked for it in 40 samples in 10 U.S. chlorinated drinking water systems located in seven states. We did find it in all the samples,&#8221; Wahman said.</p>



<p>He added that it&#8217;s likely to be found in all water treated with chloramine, which about 113 million U.S. residents get in their taps.</p>



<p>The study also calls attention the possible health impact of using certain chemicals to treat tap water, not just chloramine. Some research has linked disinfected drinking water with increased rates of certain types of cancers.</p>



<p>“We don’t know what’s driving these. We have no idea if this compound is in any way related to those outcomes,” Julian Fairey, the study&#8217;s lead author and associate professor at the University of Arkansas, told NBC News. “But we have unexplained incidents of certain types of cancer from treated drinking water.”</p>



<p>However, treating drinking water with chemicals does reduce the presence of dangerous bacteria, especially those that cause cholera and typhoid, Alan Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, said.</p>



<p>“The reason you’re adding the chloramine — you want to kill the bacteria and viruses, you have a real risk-risk trade-off,” he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, is tap water safe to drink? Is it time for you to invest in a water filter? Here&#8217;s what to know.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do I need a water filter?</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drinking-water/prevention/about-choosing-home-water-filters.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>&nbsp;recommend testing your home&#8217;s tap water for the presence of harmful germs or chemicals. Then you can purchase a water filter designed to remove what you found specifically in your water.</p>



<p>If your water does not have any harmful germs or chemicals, you may decide not to use a filter. The CDC also points out that most home filters, like those in your fridge or in a pitcher, do not remove germs and typically only remove heavy metals and make the water taste better.</p>



<p>If you get your water from a well or rain, you should test it regularly for the presence of harmful germs or chemicals. For people who get their water from a public system, your utility company must provide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drinking-water/about/how-to-read-drinking-water-quality-reports.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a water safety report</a>&nbsp;every year.</p>



<p>Before purchasing a water filter, check for an NSF International certification to make sure the product works and&nbsp;<a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the NSF International database</a>&nbsp;to see what types of germs and chemicals your filter is certified to remove.</p>



<p>When it comes to chloronitramide anion, the chemical the recent study identified, you can check your utility company&#8217;s website to see if they use chlorine or chloramine. An activated carbon filter, found in many fridge and pitcher filters, may remove the byproducts of chemicals used to disinfect tap water, but more research is needed, Wahman said.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ice baths</a> after exercise are hot, especially among influencers.</p>



<p>But a new small study suggests that recreational athletes perform better if they soak in a hot tub rather than a frigid one, especially if there are breaks in their workouts, such as halftime in football and soccer, according to a report presented Thursday at the 2024 Integrative Physiology of Exercise Conference in University Park, Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>When you exercise vigorously, muscle fibers are damaged and the&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7492448/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hot water can increase blood flow</a>, which helps the muscles repair themselves and become stronger, said the study’s lead author, Mamoru Tsuyuki, a master’s student in sports and health science at Ritsumeikan University in Shiga, Japan.</p>



<p>“Also increasing muscle temperature is going to help improve power output,” Tsuyuki told NBC News in a Zoom call. “When you need to perform twice in the same day, such as in sports that have a halftime, heat is better. During the 15 or 20 minutes, if you can immerse yourself in hot water, you can probably perform better in the second half.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><div style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%" class="wp-block-embed is-type-video"><iframe class="wp-block-embed is-type-video" src="https://www.today.com/today/embedded-video/mmvo202470469573" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="yes"></iframe></div>

</div>



<p>That doesn’t mean there’s no value in icy soaks, Tsuyuki said, adding that other studies have shown that the frigid water can relieve muscle soreness. Moreover, ice is best if there is an injury.</p>



<p>Tsuyuki said he’d like to see more research comparing the benefits and disadvantages of both temperature soaks.</p>



<p>“We used endurance running, but the results might be different with other types of exercise,” he added.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is a hot soak better?</strong></h2>



<p>To take a closer look at the impact of hot and icy soaks, Tsuyuki and his colleagues rounded up 10 young men to perform in a three-part study.</p>



<p>The men performed 50 minutes of high-intensity interval running and then soaked for 20 minutes in a 59-degree tub; a 104-degree tub; or sat without immersing themselves in water.</p>



<p>All 10 men experienced all three conditions during the study.</p>



<p>One hour after the initial workout, the study volunteers were asked to jump as high as they could from standing and squatting positions. The height the men attained when jumping was lower after a cold soak than a hot one.</p>



<p>There was no difference in muscle soreness whether the men soaked in cold or hot water.</p>



<p>“Ice baths are super trendy,” said Aimee Layton, an associate professor of applied physiology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. And “when you have an injury with heat and inflammation, the cold feels good. If you sprain an ankle, you want to put ice on it.”</p>



<p>But if you are not injured and just had a hard workout, cold can be detrimental, Layton said. “It constricts blood vessels and can cause the muscles to tighten,” she added.</p>



<p>When you work out vigorously, you get micro-tears in the muscles, Layton said. “It’s what tells your body you need more muscle in the area to make it stronger for the next time,” she said. “Hot water can increase circulation and may promote the recovery process.”</p>



<p>The temperature question can be complicated, said Dr. Spencer Stein, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine who specializes in sports medicine. “I wouldn’t throw out cold baths,” Stein said. “There are studies that show cold baths can decrease soreness.”</p>



<p>Still, “my experience with pro teams is they like warm baths before games,” he said. “If there’s a halftime, they don’t do a cold plunge.”</p>



<p>Which temperature of water works best for an athlete depends on a number of factors, said David Putrino, director of rehabilitation innovation at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. Both can have an impact on blood flow to the muscles.</p>



<p>Hot water improves blood flow, which can carry away waste products associated with exercise, Putrino said. Cold, on the other hand, can improve blood flow in some athletes by activating the fight-or-flight response.</p>



<p>And that’s where the nuance enters.</p>



<p>“If an athlete hates to be dumped into an ice bath and clenches up and starts shivering, you get the opposite effect,” Putrino said. “Someone who really doesn’t mind the cold at all can relax into an ice bath.”</p>



<p>There are people who love to do the cold plunges because they feel energized when they get out of the water, Putrino said. “Once they get out, their body is flooded with endorphins, the feel-good chemicals, and they get an immense rush of energy,” he explained.</p>



<p>“My recommendation is to use your own data to understand what works for you,” Putrino said. “Don’t believe what you’re hearing on podcasts.”</p>



<p>For a hot water soak, Putrino suggests:</p>



<ul>
<li>10 to 20 minutes at 98 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
</ul>



<p>The optimal amount of time for ice water immersion is:</p>



<ul>
<li>10 to 15 minutes at temperatures ranging from 50 to 59 degrees.</li>
</ul>



<p>For people trying a cold soak for the first time, 5 minutes can be beneficial.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a fan of cold or hot, experiment and keep track of which temperature soak helps you recover the quickest, Putrino said.</p>

<p>Sitting too much may be linked to cardiovascular issues later in life regardless of how much you exercise, according to a study released Friday.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of research supporting the importance of physical activity,&#8221; said Shaan Khurshid, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a co-senior author on the study. &#8220;In contrast, there&#8217;s relatively little know about sedentary behavior, and because of that, the guidelines are not as specific about what we should be doing about sedentary behavior.&#8221;</p>



<p>The study, published by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735109724099200?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Journal of the American College of Cardiology</a>, found that individuals who spend more than 10.6 hours per day in a sedentary state — defined as sitting, reclining or laying down — are 40% more likely to develop experience heart failure and 54% more likely to experience fatal cardiac events. The research also showed an increased likelihood of the development of heart attack and stroke, but to a lesser extent.</p>



<p>Researchers looked at data collected by a United Kingdom-based research center, UK Biobank, in which almost 90,000 individuals wore wrist-based activity trackers for a week. They then compared each individual&#8217;s recorded sedentary behavior with future diagnoses of various cardiac diseases.</p>



<p>The study also suggested that going for a run before work won&#8217;t make up for sitting at your desk all day, Khurshid said.</p>



<p>Previous studies that focused on the importance of exercise recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. According to this new data, however, the consequences of excess sedentary behavior are independent of how much exercise an individual gets. </p>



<p>&#8220;Interestingly, we still saw those [negative] associations even among people who met those guideline-recommended levels of exercise,&#8221; Khurshid said. &#8220;Among individuals that 150 minutes per week, we still saw substantially higher risks of [cardiovascular] death if they were also sedentary.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a result, the researchers concluded that the best way to reduce the negative effects of sitting too much is by reducing the amount of time spent in a resting position. </p>

<p>According to Ezim Ajufo, a cardiology fellow at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and the lead author on the study, excess sitting causes inflammation, changes in metabolism and abnormalities in muscle structure. Exercise not only reduces those negative consequences, but strengthens the heart as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Exercise] has this really interesting positive remodeling effect on the heart,&#8221; Ajufo said. &#8220;It makes your heart more efficient in giving blood to the body.&#8221;</p>



<p>Essentially, she said, consistent exercise teaches the heart to pump out more blood with each beat, decreasing the number of heartbeats needed to supply the body with a sufficient amount of blood for both functionality and recovery, and thus reducing the amount of work the heart needs to do.</p>



<p>Though the study did not focus on what kinds of exercise best mitigate the effects of sitting too much — a question Khurshid hopes researchers will answer in the near future — both he and Ajufo said it&#8217;s clear that substituting the time spent sitting with minimal physical activity can go a long way toward increasing heart health.</p>



<p>&#8220;We found that, regardless of how [individuals] reallocated [sitting time], as long as they went from sedentary behavior to something else, they substantially lowered their risk of heart failure and [cardiovascular] death,&#8221; Khurshid said. &#8220;Even if you could work in a couple days of the week where you&#8217;re not above 10.6 [hours] when you used to be, that&#8217;s likely beneficial.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a world that requires many people to be at a desk and in front of a computer all day, finding the chance to move around can be difficult — even more so if your job is remote and doesn&#8217;t require a commute. With that in mind, Khurshid and Ajufo suggest things like taking a walk while you&#8217;re in a meeting, lightly using a treadmill or walking pad at your desk or even gardening.</p>



<p>But before one can accurately reduce time spent in a resting position, the amount of time spent sitting needs to be measured, Ajufo said. Popular wrist-worn activity trackers have helped measure movement, but the same technology doesn&#8217;t exist — or at least, isn&#8217;t nearly as accessible — for measuring sedentary behavior.</p>



<p>&#8220;The reason that a lot of us are better about taking steps and things like that is we can measure it now. You can see how you&#8217;re doing, and it&#8217;s almost a gamification of that lifestyle metric, Ajufo said. &#8220;We now need to have sitting time be measured in a more mainstream way, in the way that we measure steps and other things.&#8221;</p>



<p>Though the study&#8217;s large sample size was helpful in providing an accurate picture of the effects of sedentary behavior, it&#8217;s important to note the questions that are left unanswered and the limitations of this particular data set, Khurshid said. A week is the standard metric used in similar wrist-based activity-monitoring studies, but future studies may want to consider using data collected over a longer period of time. </p>



<p>Ajufo also noted that the data is also only observational, meaning that while the researchers can draw conclusions, a more formal, controlled study is necessary to verify the link between sedentary behavior and heart disease. </p>



<p>Additionally, she said, because the data was collected in the United Kingdom, where the population is mostly white, it may not be representative of the more diverse population in the United States although it&#8217;s likely generally applicable. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that there is a silver lining, Ajufo said. Getting real exercise outside of the minimal activity you can weave into your workday is still good, and if you know you sit too much, you&#8217;re not doomed forever. Just get up and move.</p>



<p>&#8220;Folks that are wanting to implement these findings in their lives — just do something that isn&#8217;t sitting,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Whether it&#8217;s jogging or something more vigorous, there is something you can do about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kids and people nostalgic for their childhood days are once again going to race like blood through the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fi.edu/en/exhibits-and-experiences/giant-heart" data-type="link" data-id="https://fi.edu/en/exhibits-and-experiences/giant-heart" target="_blank">Franklin Institute&#8217;s Giant Heart</a> months after the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/franklin-institute-giant-heart-closing/3846887/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/franklin-institute-giant-heart-closing/3846887/">beloved attraction closed for an &#8220;Odyssey</a>&#8221; to its surrounding exhibit.</p>



<p>The massive replica heart with a distinctive smell that lets children of all ages act like blood pumping through the organ has stood in the Franklin Institute&#8217;s Center City Philadelphia location for more than 70 years.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hear the sounds of an actual human heartbeat as you go through the chambers,&#8221; the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fi.edu/en" data-type="link" data-id="https://fi.edu/en" target="_blank">Franklin Institute</a> says on its website.</p>



<p>(This writer loves running with his kids through the &#8220;Oxygen Exchange&#8221; section.)</p>



<p>The Giant Heart room <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/franklin-institute-giant-heart-closing/3846887/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/franklin-institute-giant-heart-closing/3846887/">closed in May</a> so it could be turned into something more body-focused. Luckily, the heart is back after surgical repairs to its surrounding space, being <a href="https://fi.edu/en/exhibits-and-experiences/body-odyssey" data-type="link" data-id="https://fi.edu/en/exhibits-and-experiences/body-odyssey">dubbed &#8220;Body Odyssey</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Body Odyssey opens on Nov. 23, 2024, alongside the revamped Baldwin train room as part of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fi.edu/en/exhibits-and-experiences/hamilton-collections-gallery-opening-november-23" data-type="link" data-id="https://fi.edu/en/exhibits-and-experiences/hamilton-collections-gallery-opening-november-23" target="_blank">The Hamilton Collections Gallery</a>. The ribbons on both exhibits were ceremonially cut on Wednesday as the museum gave the media a sneak peek.</p>

<p>The heart will look the same but has undergone a little cosmetic surgery.</p>



<p>Franklin Institute President and CEO Larry Dubinski <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/franklin-institute-new-exhibits-hamilton-human-body-giant-heart-train/3972288/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/franklin-institute-new-exhibits-hamilton-human-body-giant-heart-train/3972288/">told NBC10 back in September</a> that the Giant Heart&#8217;s upgrade will keep the heart the same, but the paper mache creation has been &#8220;fiber-glassed over.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It has been cleaned up a little bit,&#8221; Dubinski said. &#8220;It will also have an exhibition in it which you&#8217;re going to hear your heartbeat coming from the Giant Heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>That sounds cool. What else does the new exhibit feature?</p>



<p>&#8220;Curiosity meets discovery in&nbsp;Body Odyssey, where the walkthrough Giant Heart is just the beginning,&#8221; FI writes on its site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Embark on an immersive journey through&nbsp;the intricacies of the human body, exploring how its inner workings interact with the world around us to achieve&nbsp;balance in life and well-being. Travel through the circulatory system, explore the complexity of senses and perception, and see firsthand how the latest technology and data push the boundaries of medicine and human performance.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all about being hands on.</p>



<p>&#8220;What special and what&#8217;s new about this exhibit is that we&#8217;re really telling a much more balanced story about what the human body is all about,&#8221; FI&#8217;s director of science content, Jaytari Das said Wednesday. &#8220;Our goal is we want people to really actively participate in their learning.&#8221; </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>A new exhibit featuring the Baldwin 60,000 steam locomotive</strong></h2>



<p>Fans of the once-moving locomotive have been unable to step inside for months as well. Now, the Baldwin 60,000 steam locomotive is the suspended centerpiece of the new Hamilton Collections Gallery.</p>



<p>&#8220;Suspended on a cutaway floor, this iconic locomotive invites guests to climb aboard and witness firsthand the ingenuity that powered the Industrial Revolution,&#8221; <a href="https://fi.edu/en/exhibits-and-experiences/hamilton-collections-gallery-opening-november-23" data-type="link" data-id="https://fi.edu/en/exhibits-and-experiences/hamilton-collections-gallery-opening-november-23">FI writes</a>. &#8220;Marvel at the intricate machinery and feel the pulse of innovation as you explore every detail of this magnificent piece of machinery.&#8221;</p>



<p>The new space includes lots of other artifacts.</p>



<p>&#8220;Surrounding the Baldwin 60,000, guests will discover a treasure trove of rare artifacts meticulously curated from The Franklin Institute&#8217;s collections,&#8221; FI said. &#8220;From the earliest film projectors to the groundbreaking designs of the Wright brothers, each item on display tells a story of human achievement and technological advancement. Open casework extends upwards on two levels, inviting guests to delve deeper into the history of innovation and discovery.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;One of the things we&#8217;ve done in Hamilton Collections Gallery is create open storage, so that people, visitors, can come in and see objects that haven&#8217;t been on display ever,&#8221; Dubinski said Wednesday.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Franklin Institutes making upgrades for 200th anniversary</strong></h2>



<p>The exhibit closures were part of the museum&#8217;s bicentennial transformation, dubbed &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fi.edu/en/plan-your-visit/200-years-science-franklin-institute-transforming" data-type="link" data-id="https://fi.edu/en/plan-your-visit/200-years-science-franklin-institute-transforming" target="_blank">200 Years of Science: TFI is Transforming</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>So, what will the beloved science museum look like after all these renovations are done?</p>



<p>&#8220;Six all-new exhibits and a two-story collections gallery will transform the museum, elevating immersion, imagination, and impact. It began with the award-winning&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/the-scene/take-a-journey-around-wondrous-space-at-phillys-franklin-institute/3685904/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/the-scene/take-a-journey-around-wondrous-space-at-phillys-franklin-institute/3685904/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wondrous Space&nbsp;exhibit</a> in 2023 and continues in 2024 with the opening of an expansive new exhibit on the human body and the unveiling of the Hamilton Collections Gallery,&#8221; the museum wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;These six innovative exhibits will be the core of the new Franklin Institute experience, further enriched by our planetarium, observatory, daily live science shows, and new collections gallery. They will provide our guests with unparalleled opportunities to engage with cutting-edge scientific discoveries across various topic areas, including space, the human body, computer science, the built environment, advanced machines and robotics, and earth systems.&#8221;</p>

<p>Health disparities related to tobacco use are not equally distributed among all population groups, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/11/19/eliminating-tobacco-related-disease-death-addressing-health-disparities.html" target="_blank">the U.S. Surgeon General revealed in a new report on Tuesday. </a></p>



<p>Despite significant progress in&nbsp;reducing cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke exposure nationwide,&nbsp;the findings highlight persistent disparities linked to race and ethnicity, income, education, sexual orientation and gender identity, occupation, geography, behavioral health status, and other factors.</p>



<p>The report, which expands on data and trends found in tobacco linked to different groups by the Surgeon General in 1998, also found that cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke exposure causes nearly half a million deaths a year in the U.S. which equates to approximately one in five of all deaths.</p>



<p>“Tobacco use imposes a heavy toll on families across generations. Now is the time to accelerate our efforts to create a world in which zero lives are harmed by or lost to tobacco,” said&nbsp;Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While smoking has declined by more than 70% in the U.S. since 1965, the report finds that the number is higher among American Indian and Alaska Native people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, smoking rates are twice as high among men and women living in poverty, adults with lower education levels, individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, as well as those employed in manual labor or service jobs, residents of rural areas, and people with mental health conditions.</p>



<p>While deaths from secondhand tobacco smoke exposure have declined by over 50% since 2006, secondhand smoke exposure remains disproportionately high among non-smokers, especially children, Black people, individuals with lower incomes, and those with lower education levels.</p>



<p>To eliminate these disparities, the Surgeon General has various recommendations which include increasing education on the risks of tobacco use, expanding access to cessation programs and addressing social determinants of health. The report emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to support marginalized communities in order to reduce tobacco-related health inequities.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>When Marisa Christie arrived at the hospital for a planned C-section to deliver her triplets everything seemed to be going smoothly. But soon after giving birth, something unusual happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The doctors had pulled all three (babies) out. Actually, they were resting them on my stomach to do a delayed cord clamping,” Christie, 30, of Tomball, Texas, tells TODAY.com. “My arms flew up and that was when my heart stopped.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Christie experienced an amniotic fluid embolism (AFE), a rare, but often deadly birth complication. Luckily, doctors immediately realized what was happening and they started stabilizing Christie. Still, she spent a week unconscious. When she woke, she learned some shocking news.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My husband was like, ‘Hey, so we had the babies. They’re healthy and great,’” Christie recalls. “I was absolutely terrified … How could I not remember having my babies?”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Unexpected triplets and pregnancy complication</h2>



<p>Marisa<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and Dillon Christie have a 4-year-old son and had been trying to have another baby for about two years. Eventually, Christie spoke with her doctors and started an ovulation trigger shot, which encourages egg maturation to assist pregnancy. She was thrilled when she became pregnant, but she received some unexpected news after her first ultrasound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They were like, ‘We’re pretty sure it’s twins. There might be a third one hiding,’” she says. “I was in complete shock.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She “cried most of that month” as the couple considered life with four children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was like, ‘There’s no way we could physically do this,’” she says.</p>



<p>Soon, their worry turned to excitement, even though being pregnant with multiples was tough at times. Christie felt exhausted all the time and she felt “very sick” for the first five months. By the end of her pregnancy, it was tiring to stand for too long. Then, they learned that one of the three babies had its own separate twin that never developed, and needed to undergo a procedure while in the womb.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our baby C was sharing a sack with a twin but that twin never got a heartbeat,” Christie explains. “That (twin) was still getting blood flow.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-11/mother-triplets-2-te-241114-24433a.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Doctors had to remove the remains because the lessened blood flow “was putting too much stress on baby C’s heart.”</p>



<p>“That was a little scary,” Christie says.</p>



<p>On Aug. 21, at 33 weeks pregnant, Marisa and Dillion Christie arrived at Memorial Hermann Medical Center in Houston for a planned C-section. Her OB-GYN, Dr. Amber Samuel, delivered the three babies successfully. As they rested on Christie, though, Dr. Ricardo Mora, the anesthesiologist, noticed she was seizing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She (was) essentially gray,” Mora, an anesthesiologist affiliated with Memorial Hermann the Woodlands Medical Center, tells TODAY.com. “I knew something terrible just occurred.”</p>



<p>About 15 years ago, Mora was the anesthesiologist during a delivery where a mom experienced an amniotic fluid embolism, basically an intense allergic reaction to amniotic fluid after delivery. Immediately, he knew Christie was experiencing that same emergency. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s pretty catastrophic. When it occurs it’s about 80%, 85% fatal,” Mora says. “I asked Dr. Samuel what she had done. She related to me that she had just started pulling the placenta out and that’s usually the time when this occurs — the separation of the placenta and uterus.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mora called a code blue because he knew they needed help and medical staff flooded into the room. The situation was dire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She wasn’t breathing,” Mora says. “We started CPR because she had no pulse.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mora and his colleagues performed CPR while she hemorrhaged. Doctors kept replacing her blood, while Samuel tried to stop the bleeding by closing the uterus. Meanwhile Dr. Stephen Maniscalco,&nbsp;a cardiothoracic and vascular surgeon, prepared to place Christie on ECMO, a machine that works for the heart and lungs to help the body recover. Almost an hour after her heart stopped, ECMO was pumping blood for Christie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She essentially lost what we consider her whole blood volume,” Mora says. “We replaced her blood volume. So, for 45 minutes she was clinically dead.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Christie was in the intensive care unit after she stabilized on ECMO, she began bleeding again and Samuel brought Christie back to the operating room. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Anything that can bleed will because you don’t have the normal clotting factors,” Samuel, who&#8217;s also a maternal fetal medicine physician at Memorial Hermann the Woodlands Medical Center, tells TODAY.com.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Samuel tried medications and devices to encourage the uterus to “clamp down” and stop bleeding. But nothing worked and Christie experienced uncontrolled hemorrhaging from her uterus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We tried to resuscitate her and prevent her from having a hysterectomy,” Samuel says. “Cutting into (her) was very very dangerous.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, they eventually needed to remove the uterus. To help her heal, doctors left the incision open so they wouldn’t have to perform subsequent surgeries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There are lots of little, tiny blood vessels that in normal circumstances will just clot up and stop bleeding on their own,” Samuel says. But in patients with an amniotic fluid embolism, “if you close that up, what happens inevitably is that (blood vessels) dump a bunch of blood in that space, and it causes it to re-open.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Amniotic fluid embolisms</h2>



<p>Amniotic fluid embolisms are “very rare occurrences.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The likelihood of it happening to any individual mom who might be reading this is incredibly low,” Samuel says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, doctors remain uncertain what causes it, though being pregnant with multiples is a risk factor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a little bit like getting struck by lightning,” Samuel. “Unfortunately, it happens sometimes to some people. Almost never again to the same people if they survive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite how uncommon they are, doctors know they’re a potentially fatal medical emergency and many hospitals prepare to address them if they should occur, she adds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An amniotic fluid embolism occurs when some fetal substance crosses from the baby’s circulation to the mom’s circulation, Samuel says. In the past, doctors once thought that tissue moved into the mother’s lungs causing an embolism or a blockage that impacts normal heart and lung function by blocking circulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“More recent studies show that actually what’s happening is some sort of anaphylactoid — which means like an allergic reaction but not — to some protein that moms are exposed to which basically causes a bunch of different problems,” Samuel says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The body reacts by shutting down blood flow which leaves the lungs and the heart starts failing. Then people begin clotting and bleeding at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s something called DIC or disseminated intravascular coagulation,” Samuel says. “You immediately make a bunch of blood clots, but you also start bleeding from everywhere.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This makes treating it challenging for doctors. Clots can cause more blockages making it hard for the organs to work properly and blood loss means patients constantly need to undergo transfusions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Every organ system is failing immediately so you need people to take care of every organ system,” Samuel says. “Having access to blood products, having access to ECMO, which is what Marisa went on, those things are vital to surviving.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">‘Stronger and stronger’&nbsp;</h2>



<p>For a week, Christie remained unconscious while she was sedated and on ECMO. Mora visited her often, hoping to see signs of improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can do the best CPR in the world, but if you don’t get enough blood to the brain, essentially they are alive but with brain damage,” he says. “I needed her to live to raise her kids. So, it was a personal thing for me.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-11/mother-triplets-3-te-241114-fc305e.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>After a few days, Mora noticed Christie fluttered her eyes and seemed as if she heard people talking around her. These signs gave him hope. After she was weaned off the breathing machine and ECMO, he talked to her, relieved by how she was doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Essentially, she got stronger and stronger,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Christie felt confused and thought she was experiencing the vivid dreams she had throughout pregnancy when she first woke. After realizing she delivered her triplets, she felt the pain from the open wound, which made her realize that being in the hospital was reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The pain that I felt, I’m like there’s no way this is not real,” she says. “That’s the first very coherent thought I remember having.”</p>



<p>The triplet girls were “completely healthy” but stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit to gain weight and learn how to eat. When Christine first met the babies Charlotte, Kendall and Collins, it felt “very surreal.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I remember thinking, ‘I don’t know these babies. This is very strange. They feel like they’re not real. They feel like they’re not mine,’” she says. “They were already over a week old by the time I had met them … It took a little bit to get that connection with them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>They knew her. Staff placed baby blankets on Christie while she was in the ICU, and they swaddled the babies in them so they knew how their mom smelled. Christie also did skin-to-skin with them while she was unconscious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They could tell that I was their mom,” she says. “They respond to me when I talk to them as opposed to other people.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Christie returned home, she still had an open wound. Fortunately, she was able to rest at home for a week before the oldest baby, Charlotte, came home —&nbsp;the first of the three.</p>



<p>“I basically lived in a recliner in our living room because I couldn’t really get up and move. I was attached to a wound vac,” she says. “My core is completely obliterated. So, it was really really hard for me to move.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Kendall and Collins followed Charlotte, who already exhibits big eldest daughter energy and is the “ringleader,” home. Having the babies leave the hospital in staggered order helped Christie adjust to life with a toddler and multiple infants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That was a blessing in disguise,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nine weeks after her delivery, her wound finally healed. Grappling with a health crisis has been tough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I feel very disconnected to whoever (I) was before,” Christie says. “I’ve gotten stronger, but I’ve also changed so much because going through a traumatic experience like that changes the way you view things.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Christie shared her story to raise awareness of amniotic fluid embolism and offer others hope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s rare but it does happen,” she says. “There were so many miracles that led up to me living instead of dying and we’re grateful.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>Nearly 12 million cases of dengue fever have been recorded in the Americas this year, close to triple last year’s total.</li>



<li>New research suggests that climate change is responsible for nearly a fifth of the world’s dengue burden.</li>



<li>That share is likely to rise significantly in the future, according to the findings.</li>
</ul>



<p>It has been an exceptionally bad year for dengue fever:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-alert-increase-dengue-cases-americas-region-7-october-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nearly 12 million cases</a>&nbsp;were recorded in the Americas through October, close to triple last year’s total of 4.6 million.</p>



<p>Research being presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene on Saturday quantifies the role that climate change has played in the trend, attributing nearly a fifth of the existing dengue burden to rising temperatures, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dengue-fever-climate-change-rcna179629" target="_blank">NBC News reported.</a></p>



<p>By 2050, the research predicts, climate change could be responsible for a 60% increase in the incidence of dengue if emissions continue at pace, with some places — like parts of Peru, Mexico, Bolivia and Brazil — seeing spikes of up to 200%.</p>



<p>Public health experts have long warned that global warming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dengue-fever-climate-change-mosquitos-tropical-disease-rcna149366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enables mosquito-borne diseases to spread</a>&nbsp;to new places because it expands the geographic range where the insects that serve as vectors live and thrive. Mallory Harris, a co-author of the new research and a postdoctoral associate in the University of Maryland’s biology department, said her team’s findings build evidence for the significant role climate change has played in dengue’s spread. More broadly, she said, the research highlights the connection between greenhouse gas emissions and specific health consequences.</p>



<p>“Dengue is a growing health threat that can cause really severe consequences. It’s something that we need to be preparing for,” Harris said. “We should be expecting these sorts of large epidemics in the future and thinking about ways to then respond to them.”</p>



<p>In the United States and its territories,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/data-research/facts-stats/current-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 7,200 dengue cases</a>&nbsp;have been tallied so far this year — more than double&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cdc-warns-increased-dengue-fever-risk-us-rcna158851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year’s total</a>&nbsp;and the highest since 2013.</p>



<p>In June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cdc-warns-increased-dengue-fever-risk-us-rcna158851" target="_blank">issued a health advisory</a>&nbsp;warning of an increased risk of dengue infections. After two locally acquired cases were detected in the Florida Keys, the Monroe County Department of Health&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/health-officials-florida-keys-issue-local-dengue-fever-alert-rcna159931" target="_blank">issued an alert</a>&nbsp;of its own the next month. To date, 53 locally acquired cases — meaning they were not associated with travel to a country where dengue is prevalent —&nbsp;have been recorded in Florida, according to the CDC. California has recorded 15 such cases.</p>

<p>But the vast majority of U.S. cases this year have been in Puerto Rico, which&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/dengue-fever-outbreak-puerto-rico-creates-public-health-emergency-rcna145470" target="_blank">declared a public health emergency in March</a>&nbsp;amid an alarming rise in dengue infections. More than 4,500 locally acquired dengue cases have been reported in Puerto Rico, compared to less than 1,300 last year and even fewer the year before.</p>



<p>The new research, which has not yet been published or peer-reviewed, analyzed temperature records and incidence data on dengue across 21 countries in Asia and the Americas over an average of 11 years. The researchers compared the data to a simulation of what would have happened during that time period without human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>The resulting estimates are likely at the low end of the spectrum, according to a news release about the findings, because of a lack of dengue data from some areas, such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Plus, predictions for the southern U.S. are difficult to make, given that the virus has only recently emerged as a local threat.</p>



<p>The researchers found that the mosquitoes that carry dengue — called&nbsp;Aedes aegypti — transmit the virus most efficiently when temperatures are between 68 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. They concluded that even if global greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced, the majority of the countries analyzed would still see climate-driven increases in dengue.</p>



<p>“The risks of this are going to increase regardless, so we need to be thinking about mitigation,” Harris said, suggesting a focus on vaccines and efforts to curb mosquito populations.</p>



<p>The maker of the only Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine for dengue discontinued it earlier this year,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/hcp/vaccine/index.html" target="_blank">according to the CDC.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10559824/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">More than half of people</a>&nbsp;who contract dengue,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dengue-fever-climate-change-mosquitos-tropical-disease-rcna149366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a viral fever</a>, are asymptomatic. Most of the rest experience mild cases, with symptoms that can include a fever, headache, joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Severe infections — about 2% of cases in U.S. territories from 2010 to 2020, according to the CDC — can cause bleeding under the skin, in the nose or in urine or stool, as well as a sudden drop in blood pressure or even death.</p>



<p>The disease is most common in places with humid, tropical climates across Latin America.</p>



<p>Derek Cummings, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health<strong>&nbsp;</strong>who was not involved in the new research, said it takes “something that we all knew — that the temperature is important — but quantifies how much and how important it is to the changes we’re seeing.”</p>



<p>Cummings, who has published his own research on dengue, added that on a global scale, he foresees a need to prioritize vaccinates, better manage mosquito populations and ensure hospitals and health care providers prepare for a rise in dengue cases.</p>



<p>Harris emphasized that the new research shows how climate change’s consequences affect various parts of the world differently.</p>



<p>“The greatest impacts of historic climate change on dengue burden were in places like Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, which are not necessarily the places that are the overall hottest. They’re not necessarily the places that are having the greatest increases in heat deaths,” she said. “There are effects that you might experience in places that are marginally cooler that also need to be taken into account.”</p>

<p>&#8220;The risk to the general population is low,&#8221; said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. “After exposure, in about 4-7 days, you get flu-like symptoms, so headache, muscle aches, fever. But 2-3 days after that, you start getting these boils that people know about from 2022.”</p>



<p>The United States is the sixth country outside Africa to have detected the clade I strain, according to the CDC, which can cause more severe illness than the version of the virus that spread widely in 2022.</p>



<p>The spread of this strain through several African countries prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global public health emergency in August, the second time mpox has been introduced in two years.</p>



<p>Chin-Hong said it&#8217;s unclear how the new strain might spread in the U.S. However, some experts anticipate it could spread among the same sexual networks as Clade II did in 2022. </p>



<p>“The one that we saw in 2022 is mainly confined to men who have sex with men,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[I]f you got one shot, make sure you get the second.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A trip to the beach has turned Brooklyn McCasland’s life upside down after she contracted a vision-threatening eye infection while swimming in her contact lenses.</p>



<p>It happens when a parasite that can be found in water invades the eye, damaging the cornea, causing severe pain and potentially leading to blindness. The condition, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/can-you-swim-contact-lenses-doctors-warn-about-infection-t137973" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acanthamoeba keratitis</a>, is rare in the U.S., but when it does strike, it most often affects contact-lens wearers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McCasland, 23, who has lost vision in her right eye and is waiting for a corneal transplant, must now spend her days in a dark room because of the extreme eye pain and light sensitivity. She says she wants to spread awareness about the rare eye infection.</p>



<p>“I’ve been going to the eye doctor since I was 7, having checkups every single year, and not (during) one of those visits have they ever said to not swim or shower in my contacts,” she tells TODAY.com.</p>



<p>“I think there’s still a lot of people who don’t know, like myself.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Contact lenses and water don&#8217;t mix</strong></h2>



<p>McCasland, who lives in Longview, Texas, has been wearing contact lenses for 16 years. She says she’s always practiced good lens-wearing habits, including changing the solution as directed and never sleeping in her lenses.</p>



<p>She wears monthly contacts, which means she takes them out every night, and replaces them with a new pair after a month of wear.</p>



<p>In late August, McCasland went on a girls beach trip to Alabama and swam underwater in the Gulf of Mexico while wearing her contact lenses.</p>



<p>Contact lenses and water “are a bad combination” because water makes contact lens wearers vulnerable to eye infections, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/contact-lenses/about/healthy-habits-keeping-water-away-from-contact-lenses.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>&nbsp;warns.</p>



<p>People should never wear contacts while showering or swimming, the agency notes.</p>



<p>But like many contact lens wearers, McCasland had never heard that warning.</p>



<p>About a week after she got back from the beach, she started to feel like there was something in her right eye. That sensation turned into sharp pain a few days later. McCasland went to her eye doctor and received antibiotic drops and other treatments, but nothing helped.</p>



<p>It would take weeks to get the correct diagnosis: Acanthamoeba keratitis.</p>

<p>Acanthamoeba are single-celled organisms that can be found in pools, hot tubs, tap water and shower water, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://eyewiki.org/Acanthamoeba_Keratitis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Academy of Ophthalmology</a>.</p>



<p>They can invade the eye through a minor abrasion in the cornea and infect it, causing severe pain, inflammation and even blindness, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acanthamoeba/hcp/clinical-overview-acanthamoeba-keratitis/index.html" target="_blank">CDC notes</a>.</p>



<p>Soft contact lenses can act like a sponge, absorbing water and impurities in it such as Acanthamoeba, and becoming their portal of entry into the cornea, Dr. Thomas Steinemann, a clinical spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/can-you-swim-contact-lenses-doctors-warn-about-infection-t137973" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously told TODAY.com</a>.</p>



<p>Contact lenses can also create tiny cuts on the eye that make it easier for the parasite to enter as they become trapped under the lens, Dr. Danielle Trief, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at the Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute at Columbia University Medical Center in New York,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/can-you-get-infection-contacts-man-details-parasitic-infection-led-t158200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously told TODAY.com</a>.</p>



<p>There are one to nine cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis per 100,000 people, with up to 93% of cases happening among contact lens wearers, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549863/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Library of Medicine</a>.</p>



<p>Because it’s so rare, Acanthamoeba keratitis is difficult to diagnose. McCasland says she was misdiagnosed for a month.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>&#8216;Feels like there’s glass in your eye&#8217;</strong></h2>



<p>Her eye doctor finally sent her to a cornea specialist, who quickly suspected Acanthamoeba keratitis. Confirmation required scraping cells off her eye with a metal tool.</p>



<p>Treatment involved inserting chlorhexidine and Brolene antimicrobial eye drops into her eyes every 30 minutes day and night, and then from 6 a.m. to midnight. She may go down to four times a day soon.</p>



<p>She’s also taking Impavido, an anti-parasitic drug, three times a day.</p>



<p>McCasland hasn’t been able to work at her job as a barista in a coffee shop for more than a month because of the severe eye pain.</p>



<p>“It feels like there’s glass in your eye,” she says. “I don’t think people understand how intense the pain is. It’s really debilitating.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-11/Brooklyn-McCasland-eye-infection-contacts-mc-241111-03-be2214.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="Brooklyn McCasland" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">McCasland&#8217;s right eye continues to be cloudy as she battles the infection.

</div>



<p>Her medication comes with side effects that make her sick. She also suffers from headaches caused by the cornea inflammation, and experiences nerve pain that goes up the right side of her head and into her cheek bone. Pain medications only help for a little bit, she says.</p>



<p>Because she’s supremely light sensitive, McCasland keeps her eyes closed as much as possible and stays in her bedroom with blankets covering her windows for extra darkness. She only leaves for doctor appointments. She can’t drive, so her boyfriend takes her.</p>



<p>A corneal transplant will hopefully restore the vision in her right eye, but that may not happen for a year — until her doctor is sure the infection is completely gone from her eye.</p>



<p>“I’m very social. I like to go out. So for me to just sit in a dark room all day … it’s been super, super hard,” McCasland says.</p>



<p>“I’m still looking at a long road of recovery. But I wanted to spread awareness for this.”</p>



<p>McCasland’s friend has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for her expenses as she recovers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to avoid the infection:</strong></h2>



<p>The CDC has these tips:</p>



<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t swim, shower or use hot tubs while wearing contact lenses.</li>



<li>If water touches contact lenses for any reason, take them out as soon as possible. Throw them away, or clean and disinfect them overnight before wearing them again.</li>



<li>Don’t use tap water to store or disinfect contacts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beer drinkers have less healthy lifestyles than wine drinkers, according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p>



<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1064415" target="_blank">research found</a> beer consumers have lower-quality diets, are classically less active and are more likely to smoke cigarettes compared to those who drink wine, liquor or a combination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study surveyed 1,900 U.S. adults on their alcohol consumption and assessed the diet quality among those who consume only beer (38.9%), wine (21.8%), liquor (18.2%) or a combination of alcohol types (21%). </p>



<p>The Healthy Eating Index, a tool based on dietary guidelines, found none of the alcohol-consumption groups came close to hitting the recommended 80-point score that is considered a well-balanced diet.&nbsp;Beer drinkers scored the lowest at 49, while wine drinkers hit 55 and both&nbsp;liquor-only drinkers and combination drinkers scored approximately 53.</p>



<p>“Alcohol overuse is the leading cause of cirrhosis in the U.S., and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is rapidly increasing,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1064415" target="_blank">said Madeline Novack</a>, chief resident at Tulane School of Medicine’s internal medicine residency program and lead author of the study. “Both types of liver disease often coexist, and lifestyle changes are key to managing and preventing these conditions, starting with understanding the link between alcohol use and poor nutrition.”</p>



<p>A possible attribution to these dietary differences could be the context in which food and alcohol are consumed together, according to Novack.</p>



<p>For instance, beer is often chosen as a beverage in settings where foods are processed and high in carbohydrates, whereas wine is oftentimes accompanied with meat and vegetables.</p>



<p>Novack noted that people often consume beer alongside fried or salty foods, which can increase their thirst.</p>



<p>The study found that beer-only drinkers were typically younger and were more likely to be male, younger, smokers and low-income. It also reported the highest total daily caloric intake with the lowest level of physical activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help prevent liver disease and other related health diseases, Novack suggests that physicians should inquire about the type of alcohol their patients consume. Using the study&#8217;s findings, doctors can offer tailored advice to beer-only drinkers, encouraging them to increase certain nutritional aspects of their diets and physical activity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy may help people&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/women-us-are-drinking-death-research-finds-rcna96848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut back on drinking</a>, new research published Wednesday in&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2024.3599?guestAccessKey=4bf50b14-c77f-4a44-9a4f-0b52c5fd0f9b&amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=111324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JAMA Psychiatry</a>&nbsp;suggests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a study of around 228,000 people in Sweden who had alcohol use disorder, researchers found that people who were taking a GLP-1 drug like semaglutide were less likely to be hospitalized for alcohol-related issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just over 28 million adults in the U.S. have alcohol addiction, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-use-disorder-aud-united-states-age-groups-and-demographic-characteristics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only three medicines, however, are approved to treat it.</p>



<p>“The pharmacological treatments available for AUD are not very good, and relapse is really common,” said Alex DiFeliceantonio, an assistant professor at Virginia Tech’s Fralin Biomedical Research Institute.</p>



<p>The study leader, Dr. Markku Lähteenvuo, a psychiatric researcher at Niuvanniemi Hospital in Finland, said: “I see so many patients who do not have good outcomes on the medications we have and who are desperate for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/alcohol-liver-disease-rising-young-people-especially-women-rcna64484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help with their addiction</a>. We really do need more tools in the toolbox.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>GLP-1 drugs — the class of medication that includes semaglutide and other popular drugs like tirzepatide — have shown potential for treating addiction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/159863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trial</a>&nbsp;published in 2022 found that an older GLP-1 drug called exenatide reduced drinking, but only among those who had both alcohol use disorder and obesity.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-48267-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Several</a>&nbsp;other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48780-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a>&nbsp;have examined drinking habits among people taking GLP-1 drugs who do not have alcohol use disorder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new study, Lähteenvuo and his team looked at medical records from 228,000 people in Swedish who were diagnosed with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/psilocybin-mushroom-help-people-alcohol-use-disorder-rcna44180" target="_blank">alcohol use disorder</a>&nbsp;from 2006 to 2023. All of the people in the study also had obesity or Type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%" class="wp-block-embed is-type-video"><iframe class="wp-block-embed is-type-video" src="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/embedded-video/mmvo159493189528" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="yes"></iframe></div>



<p>About 60% of the participants were hospitalized for alcohol use disorder at some point during the study period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around 75,000 people in the study used some type of medication to treat alcohol use disorder. Among that group, the team documented about 30,000 hospitalizations. (The researchers counted total hospitalizations, which means each tally does not necessarily represent an individual person. Some people may have been hospitalized multiple times.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The alcohol-related hospitalizations were much lower among people who took a GLP-1 drug.</p>



<p>For the roughly 4,300 people in the study who used semaglutide — the ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — there were about 220 hospitalizations for alcohol use disorder. Others in the study were taking older GLP-1 drugs, including liraglutide and dulaglutide, and also had fewer hospitalizations.</p>



<p>Using hospitalization to determine the drugs’ effects on alcohol use disorder is an imperfect measure, but experts said it is a good place to start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Alcohol withdrawal or poisoning would be why someone would require hospitalization, which is a pretty extreme outcome,” DiFeliceantonio said.</p>

<p>But hospital data is widely available, and it can help researchers determine which drugs may work for different types of addiction and which clinical trials they should run first, she added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mounting research shows GLP-1 agonists warrant a closer look, especially for alcohol addiction.</p>



<p>“We’ve known for some time from animal studies that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce alcohol intake and motivation to consume alcohol,” said Christian Hendershot, director of clinical research at the University of Southern California Institute for Addiction Science.</p>



<p>The fact that the new study included only people who have alcohol use disorder gives better information about how effective the drugs may be for people with substance addiction, he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-other-health-conditions-pcos-alzheimers-rcna90457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes drug might treat addiction</a>&nbsp;is still a mystery.</p>



<p>One theory is that its effects may have something to do with the drugs’ ability to induce the feeling of satiation. That may reduce cravings for drugs and alcohol the same way the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-weight-loss-drugs-change-people-think-thanksgiving-holiday-meals-rcna126016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drugs work on food cravings</a>, Hendershot said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They may also reduce the rewarding effects of drugs,” he said.</p>



<p>There are other theories, too. Lähteenvuo said it may have something to do with the sugar in alcohol. GLP-1 drugs, he said, make sugary beverages less appealing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Newer GLP-1 drugs, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, enter the brain in different ways from&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36066977/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">older versions that have been studied</a>, and moving forward, it will be important to test both, DiFeliceantonio said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hendershot said that although the drugs are very safe for people with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, they could present big safety risks for people without obesity or Type 2 diabetes, particularly because of the weight loss they induce.</p>



<p>Early research has also explored GLP-1 drugs for nicotine and opioid addiction, with mixed results. So far, the clearest results have come from studies on alcohol addiction — but there is still a lot to understand.</p>



<p>“Right now we only have three FDA-approved medications to treat alcohol use disorder. This pales in comparison to medications approved to treat other diseases,” Hendershot said. “Anything we can do to study other medications, including GLP-1 agonists, is critically important for our field.”</p>

<p>Janet Rapp strode briskly down a paved path through the city zoo, waving at friends and stopping briefly to greet emus she knows by name.</p>



<p>The 71-year-old retiree starts each morning this way with a walking club. </p>



<p>“I’m obsessed,” she said. Not only does it ease her joint pain, “it just gives me energy … And then it calms me, too.”</p>



<p>Medical experts agree that walking is an easy way to improve physical and mental health, bolster fitness and prevent disease. While it’s not the only sort of exercise people should do, it’s a great first step toward a healthy life.</p>



<p>“You don’t need equipment and you don’t need a gym membership,” said Dr. Sarah Eby, a sports medicine physician with Mass General Brigham. “And the benefits are so vast.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What can walking do for you?</h2>



<p>Walking can help meet the U.S. surgeon general’s recommendation that adults get at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity every week. This helps lowers the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, dementia, depression and many types of cancer.</p>



<p>Walking also improves blood sugar levels, is good for bone health and can help you lose weight and sleep better, added Julie Schmied, a nurse practitioner with Norton Healthcare, which runs the free Get Healthy Walking Club. </p>



<p>Another advantage? It’s a low-impact exercise that puts less pressure on joints as it strengthens your heart and lungs.</p>



<p>James Blankenship, 68, said joining the walking club at the Louisville Zoo last year helped him bounce back after a heart attack and triple bypass in 2022.</p>



<p>“My cardiologist says I’m doing great,” he said.</p>



<p>For all its benefits, however, walking “is not enough for overall health and well-being” because it doesn’t provide resistance training that builds muscle strength and endurance, said Anita Gust, who teaches exercise science at the University of Minnesota Crookston. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s especially important for women’s bone health as they age.</p>



<p>Experts recommend adding such activities at least twice weekly – using weights, gym equipment or your own body as resistance — and doing exercises that improve flexibility like yoga or stretching.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Do you really need 10,000 steps a day?</h2>



<p>Nearly everyone has heard about this walking goal, which dates back to a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. But experts stress that it’s just a guideline.</p>



<p>The average American walks about 3,000 to 4,000 steps a day and it&#8217;s fine to gradually work up to 10,000, Shmied said. </p>



<p>Setting a time goal can also be useful. Shmied suggests breaking the recommended 150 minutes per week into 30 minutes a day, or 10 minutes three times a day, for five days. During inclement weather, people can walk in malls or on treadmills.</p>



<p>As they become seasoned walkers, they can speed up the pace or challenge themselves with hills while still keeping the activity level moderate.</p>



<p>“If you can talk but not sing,” Eby said, “that’s what we consider moderate-intensity exercise.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How do you stay motivated?</h2>



<p>Walking with friends – including dogs – is one way.</p>



<p>Walking clubs have popped up across the nation. In 2022, New York personal trainer Brianna Joye Kohn, 31, started City Girls Who Walk with a TikTok post inviting others to walk with her. </p>



<p>“We had 250 girls show up,” she said.</p>



<p>Since then, the group has walked every Sunday for around 40 minutes, with some meeting afterward for brunch or coffee.</p>



<p>The Louisville Zoo launched its walking club in 1987, partnered with Norton in 2004 to expand it, and now boasts more than 15,000 registered members. Every day from March 1 through Oct. 31, people walk around and around the 1.4-mile loop before the zoo officially opens.</p>



<p>Tony Weiter meets two of his siblings every Friday. On a recent morning, they caught up on each other’s lives as they zipped past zebras in a fenced field and a seal sunning itself.</p>



<p>“I enjoy the serenity of it. It’s cold but the sun is shining. You get to see the animals,” said Weiter, 63. “It’s a great way to start the morning.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>In 2023, Sydney Towle, then 23, developed a bump on her abdomen that she could feel. When she exercised, she experienced a stinging in her stomach. Worried that she developed a hernia, Towle visited an urgent care clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The doctor thought I had a hernia, but he was like, ‘I’ll send you in for an ultrasound, just in case,’” Towle, now 25, of New York City, tells TODAY.com. “I got an ultrasound, and it showed a solid mass.”</p>



<p>Follow-up tests revealed Towle had bile duct cancer, also called cholangiocarcinoma, a rare cancer that forms on the network of tubes that link the liver, gallbladder and small intestine, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/liver/bile-duct-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute</a>. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/bile-duct-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>, bile duct cancers are most often diagnosed in people in their 70s. Towle felt stunned by the news.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve never heard of bile duct cancer,” she says. “I only knew the major forms of cancer like breast cancer, lymphoma.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Unexpected bump and pain</h2>



<p>While she noticed the bump for a few months, Towle didn’t visit the doctor immediately because she was “young and healthy,” she recalls. But when she started experiencing pain, she realized she needed to seek medical care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When I was going on walks, I started feeling a burning sensation in my stomach,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the ultrasound showed a mass, Towle underwent an MRI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“(It) showed that it was cancerous,” she says. “I had to go to the hospital to get a biopsy, which determines the type of cancer that I had.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biopsy revealed she had bile duct cancer, and doctors considered how to proceed with her care. At the time, it had not spread to other locations in her body.</p>



<p>“There’s not one set treatment plan because it’s such a rare cancer,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, doctors believed that chemotherapy to reduce the size of the tumor paired with surgery would effectively treat her cancer. For five months, Towle did chemotherapy and immunotherapy. At times, she felt overwhelmed with its side effects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The first few days after I got chemo, I was pretty much in bed the whole time because it makes you extremely tired,” she says. “Then I would try to go about my life as normally as possible.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She experienced extreme bloating and swelling, as well as exhaustion, but nothing more serious.</p>



<p>“I feel like I got pretty lucky with the symptoms because I am pretty young and healthy,” she says. “I wasn’t getting extremely sick.”</p>



<p>The chemotherapy worked, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I responded very well, my oncologist said,” Towle recalls. “They reduced it to good margins to the point where I could get surgery.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Towle underwent surgery in January of this year to remove the remaining mass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It went really well. I came out of it, and the surgeon said that she got all of it pretty much,” Towle says. “There was some cancer like left on the margin where they resected my liver. But overall the tumors were gone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That meant she didn’t need to restart chemotherapy, though she still had some cancer lingering in her body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My oncologist was like, ‘You’re not cancer free. You still have cancer on the margins of where they took out the tumor. &#8230; You should be fine for now and we’ll just keep an eye on it,'&#8221; Towle explains.</p>



<p>For several months, she underwent regular scans to make sure the remaining cancer didn&#8217;t grow. Everything was clear until an MRI in in August detected a small lesion. Doctors initially thought it could&#8217;ve been scar tissue from her previous surgery and scheduled another MRI for a month later to see if the spot had changed at all.</p>



<p>Doctors told Towle that if the follow-up MRI showed the spot had grown, then it was likely cancer, but if it stayed the same, it was just scar tissue.</p>



<p>“It had doubled in that time so that proved it was cancerous,&#8221; Towle says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Bile duct cancer</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/chemo-shortage-man-60-stage-4-cancer-stop-treatment-rcna87935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bile duct cancer</a>&nbsp;is rare and comes with few symptoms, which means many people are diagnosed at later stages.</p>



<p>“Sadly, we do often find these in stages where they’re not surgically manageable,” Dr. Antony Ruggeri, a medical oncologist at Aurora St. Luke’s Medical Center, who did not treat Towle, previously told TODAY.com.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/bile-duct-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/signs-symptoms.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>, symptoms can include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Jaundice or yellowing of the skin</li>



<li>Pain the upper right quadrant of the abdomen</li>



<li>Itchiness&nbsp;</li>



<li>Greasy or pale stool&nbsp;</li>



<li>Unintentional weight loss or lessened appetite</li>



<li>Dark-colored urine</li>



<li>Fever</li>
</ul>



<p>People at higher risk include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Those with certain liver or bile duct conditions, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis B or C</li>



<li>Older populations</li>



<li>Those with inflammatory bowel disease</li>



<li>Those with diabetes</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Facing cancer again</h2>



<p>Towle cannot receive chemotherapy again because her white blood cell count is too low from her previous treatment and the cancer growing back. She currently has cancer on her liver, and it has spread to one abdominal lymph node. She was told her options were surgery or joining a clinical trial.</p>



<p>“I don’t think I’ve processed it,” she says. “I’ve kind of disassociated from it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After recently moving to New York City for work, Towle is seeing a new medical team, who will conduct their own scans and take a biopsy of her cancer growth to understand it and come up with a new treatment plan.</p>



<p>While Towle appreciates that her new doctors are being thorough, it also feels &#8220;very frustrating&#8221; because all the retesting feels like a step back, she shared on her&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sydtowle/video/7433541363733368094?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok account</a>.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m trying to feel positive about it,” she said. “But it just kind of feels like I&#8217;m restarting everything.”</p>



<p>Towle has been telling her story on social media, and connecting with others has helped her navigate having such a rare cancer.</p>



<p>“They reach such a wide audience that I will get messages from people my age or with parents (who have it),” she says. “It’s been a really great way to connect with people even if it’s not my specific cancer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When she was first diagnosed, she felt touched by all the messages of support she received, and that has motivated her to continue being “transparent” about her health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m bringing light to this, and so that has encouraged me to continuing posting and sharing, especially when I am not doing well or when I receive good news,” she says. “It always seems to help people feel less alone like they’re not the only ones that are going through something that’s very challenging.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Towle hopes her experience teaches people the importance of seeking medical care when something seems wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you have some sort of warning signs, do not ignore them because I did,” she says.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Venezuela lost its final glacier this year. The Greenland Ice Sheet is losing, on average, 30 million tons of ice per hour. Ice loss from the Thwaites Glacier, also known as the “Doomsday” glacier because its collapse could precipitate rapid Antarctic ice loss,&nbsp;may be unstoppable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are just a few of the stark findings from more than 50 leading snow and ice scientists, which are detailed in a new report from the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative.</p>



<p>The report summarizes the state of snow and ice in 2024: In short, experts agree, it’s been a horrible year for the frozen parts of Earth, an expected result of global warming. What’s more, top cryosphere scientists are growing increasingly worried that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a key ocean current that governs how heat cycles in the Atlantic Ocean, is on a path toward collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A rapid halt to the current would cause rapid cooling in the North Atlantic, warming in the Southern Hemisphere and extreme changes in precipitation. If that happens, the new report suggests, northern Europe could cool by about 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit in a decade.</p>



<p>The report highlights a shift in consensus: Scientists once thought tipping points — like the collapse of AMOC — were distant or remote possibilities. Now, some of those thresholds are appearing more likely to be crossed, and with less runway to turn the situation around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The latest science is not telling us that things are any different to what we knew before, necessarily, but it’s telling us with more confidence and more certainty that these things are more likely to happen,” said Helen Findlay, an author of the report and a professor and biological oceanographer at Plymouth Marine Laboratory in England. “The longer we record these things, and the longer we’re able to observe them and start to understand and monitor them, there’s more certainty in the system and we start to really understand how these tipping points are working.”</p>



<p>Last month, 44 leading scientists wrote in an open letter to leaders of Nordic countries that&nbsp;<a href="https://en.vedur.is/media/ads_in_header/AMOC-letter_Final-export.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the collapse of AMOC remained “highly uncertain</a>” but that evidence in favor of such a collapse was mounting, and risks have been underestimated. Dramatic changes to the AMOC, they warned, would “likely lead to unprecedented extreme weather” and “potentially threaten the viability of agriculture in northwestern Europe.”</p>



<p>The new report similarly draws attention to the risk of AMOC collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, it projects that roughly two-thirds of glacier ice in the European Alps will be lost by 2050 if global greenhouse gas emissions keep their pace. Already, an estimated 10 million people are at risk of glacial outburst floods in Iceland, Alaska and Asia — a phenomenon already occurring as meltwater collapses ice dams and rapidly floods downstream. If high emissions continue, the report adds, models suggest that sea level could rise by roughly 10 feet in the 2100s, imperiling parts of many coastal cities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report was released as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taliban-will-attend-un-climate-conference-first-time-rcna179539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world leaders gathered</a>&nbsp;Monday in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, for the United Nations’ COP29 climate conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Timing is everything,” said Julie Brigham-Grette, a geosciences professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and an author of the new report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She said the group hopes to rattle world leaders to attention: “The sense of urgency couldn’t be higher. We’ve been talking about urgency for a decade. It almost starts to feel like a useless word. What’s more than ‘urgent?’ ‘Catastrophic?’ We’ve run out of ways to describe it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To date, the report says, world governments are falling short on the pledges they made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if they were on track, those commitments&nbsp;are insufficient to reach global climate goals, the authors say. On paper, the world’s pledges would limit the rise in global temperatures to about 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) this century. That’s well short of the goal to cap warming at 1.5 degrees C.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Global temperatures are currently on pace to rise more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), on average.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I feel quite frustrated,” Findlay said. “I don’t really understand how they’re missing the severity of the issue.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Baku on Monday, world leaders did agree to new rules for a global market to trade carbon credits. In a news release, COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev, who has been Azerbaijan’s minister of ecology and natural resources since 2018, said the agreement was a “game-changing” tool to direct climate financing to the developing world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But he also acknowledged, in a speech to delegates, that the world is “on a road to ruin” under current climate policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That warning and the new report both come amid fears the U.S. will backslide on its climate commitments and pull out of the Paris Agreement after Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-won-presidency-said-rcna178837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wants to remove the U.S.</a>&nbsp;from the international treaty, and he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-administration-kick-starts-formal-withdrawal-paris-climate-agreement-n1076241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began that process</a>&nbsp;during his first presidential administration.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-officially-rejoins-the-paris-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Joe Biden reversed the move</a>&nbsp;in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peter Neff, a glaciologist and climate scientist at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the new report, said its authors clearly communicated the scientific consensus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s nothing surprising for a glaciologist. Across the board, there’s not good news with respect to ice on Earth. It’s all, for the most part, going in one direction,” Neff said.</p>



<p>But he added that he still found the report’s findings to be staggering: “These documents can hit you like a ton of bricks, and that’s intentional.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Do women have a testosterone problem?</p>



<p>Social media influencers believe they do. And with the rise of telemedicine and testosterone replacement clinics opening up across the country, access to the drug has never been easier.</p>



<p>In the U.S., prescriptions for testosterone increased nearly 50% between 2013 and 2023, according to recent data from the health technology company IQVIA. Doctors say interest in the hormone isn’t being driven only by men, but also by women in their 40s and 50s.</p>



<p>“It feels almost like an epidemic,” Dr. Rebecca Dunsmoor-Su, chief medical officer for Gennev, a national telemedicine company for menopause patients, said about middle-age women seeking testosterone.&nbsp;“They’re being told this is the miracle-drug pill that they’ve been looking for.”</p>



<p>Because patients are often prescribed testosterone gels, pellets or pills through med-spas and telemedicine, there could be even more women taking the hormone than realized, Dunsmoor-Su said.</p>



<p>Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and plays a variety of roles in the human body. In men, testosterone boosts muscle mass, sex drive and deepening of the voice. In women, who also have testosterone generally in much lower levels, it also plays a role in libido, muscular health and energy.</p>



<p>Typically, testosterone levels in men are&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6391653/#:~:text=The%20greater%20magnitude%20of%20sex,circulating%20half%2Dtime%20of%20testosterone." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around 15 times higher than in women</a>.</p>



<p>In both women and men, it’s normal for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/low-testosterone/testosterone-levels-by-age#testosterone-levels-chart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testosterone levels to drop with age&nbsp;</a>— starting at about age 30 in men and around 40 in women. The decline doesn’t mean that it necessarily needs to be replaced, either for health or longevity.</p>



<p>Levels for what is considered normal can vary depending on the lab, and just because levels are low, that does not necessarily mean testosterone should be started. Doctors use a combination of symptoms and blood work in deciding whom to treat.</p>



<p>If a patient does have symptoms of “low T” — including depression, lethargy and low sex drive — doctors typically gauge levels with a blood test before deciding treatment.</p>



<p>Testosterone treatment includes a gel rubbed on the shoulder, pills or an implantable pellet in the buttocks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Why do women use testosterone?</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Amy Voedisch, an OB-GYN at Stanford Medicine in Palo Alto, California, has noticed a dramatic rise in recent years in middle-age women asking for testosterone therapy.</p>



<p>Perimenopausal symptoms begin when women reach their 40s, triggered by hormonal fluctuations and accompanied by irregular periods, brain fog, insomnia and hair loss. The changes typically begin a few years before menopause, when periods permanently end.</p>



<p>Some women may notice a decrease in sex drive as levels of estrogen and testosterone, both of which play a role in libido, start to decline as they get older.</p>



<p>“I’ll talk about menopausal hormone therapy and then they’ll say — but what about testosterone?”</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/no-heart-risks-testosterone-replacement-therapy-study-finds-rcna89229" target="_blank">Topical testosterone products</a> first hit the market in the early 2000s.</p>



<p>Voedisch, who has been in practice for decades, says the phenomenon among women<strong>&nbsp;</strong>really started to take off just in the last couple of years. Previously, interest in testosterone therapy rarely came up in appointments, she said.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><div style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%" class="wp-block-embed is-type-video"><iframe class="wp-block-embed is-type-video" src="https://www.today.com/today/embedded-video/mmvo211124805562" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="yes"></iframe></div></div>



<p>Now, virtually every new menopause patient she sees will ask about it.</p>



<p>A patient will say, “I was listening to this podcast, and they said that I needed this,” she said. “Or I have this Instagram person that I follow and she said that I absolutely have to be on it.”</p>



<p>On the Reddit community&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r/menopause</a>, scores of posts tout the drug’s benefits of improved energy and sex drive for women.</p>



<p>Few of the claims are supported by evidence, Dunsmoor-Su said.</p>



<p>“It’ll give them energy, it’ll make them thin, it will make them horny, like they’ve been promised,” she said, describing common claims about the drug. “It does everything — and all of their problems are just because they’re a little low in testosterone.”</p>



<p>Dr. Traci Kurtzer, a menopause specialist at the Northwestern Medicine Center for Sexual Medicine and Menopause in Chicago, agreed the push for testosterone started happening in recent years. Her patients inquire about testosterone therapy for multiple problems — to improve mood, energy, sex drive, brain fog and muscle mass.</p>



<p>She tells patients that testosterone therapy is currently only recommended for a low sex drive, although future research may find other benefits.</p>



<p>“If that’s the case, that’ll be wonderful, but at this point in time we don’t have the data to support that,” Kurtzer said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Does testosterone help women?</strong></h2>



<p>The Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved testosterone therapy for women. However, doctors can prescribe it for low sex drive after other causes, including medical and psychological ones, are ruled out, said Dr. Jan Shifren, director of Massachusetts General Hospital’s Midlife Women’s Health Center in Boston.</p>



<p>Shifren, who has been involved in clinical trials looking at testosterone therapy in women, said that the benefits for women with low libido aren’t terribly impressive.</p>



<p>“Women who are randomized to testosterone, compared with placebo, have one additional satisfying sexual event in four weeks, compared with placebo,” she said.</p>



<p>In addition to declining hormonal levels, causes of low libido in women can include relationship problems, anxiety or depression, and metabolic conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Discomfort from vaginal dryness from menopause is another reason. Exhaustion from caregiving and other family responsibilities also take their toll, doctors say.</p>



<p>Shifren urges women to address all other possible causes of low libido before starting testosterone.</p>



<p>“It’s not that I don’t sometimes prescribe it, but it’s after addressing a lot of other concerns,” she said.</p>



<p>For Marcella Hill, 44, the symptoms of depression, body aches and low sex drive were affecting her relationship with her husband.</p>



<p>“I was really suffering,” said Hill who lives in Vineyard, Utah. Her doctor told her that<strong>&nbsp;</strong>it was just normal.</p>



<p>“I thought that’s insane. I can’t live like this,” Hill said.</p>



<p>At first, she was given a testosterone gel prescription but didn’t notice an improvement and found it hard to use.</p>



<p>Frustrated that her doctor didn’t offer more help, she went to a local medical clinic at a friend’s urging and started testosterone pellet therapy, a more potent version of the hormone.</p>



<p>After two years of treatment, she says the results have been life-changing.</p>



<p>“A couple months into it, all of a sudden my libido turns back on,” she said. “I want to be with my husband and I have this passion, this desire that I hadn’t had since college.”</p>



<p>She posts about her <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/beingmarcellahill/?hl=en" target="_blank">testosterone therapy on Instagram and other social media</a>.</p>



<p>“​​I opened TikTok to just tell that story, and the next day my phone blew up with 9 million views,” she said. “Women all over the whole world were like, ‘Wait, I have all these symptoms.’”</p>



<p>Hill isn’t paid for promoting testosterone, although she has worked with a telehealth company in ads urging women to get regular medical checkups.</p>



<p>She gets her levels checked regularly and says that her testosterone is closer to the low end for a male. While she is not worried about her high levels, she does have an unwanted side effect — excess hair growth on her face.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Is testosterone therapy safe?</h2>



<p>When prescribed by a doctor and carefully monitored, testosterone is relatively safe for women and side effects are rare, experts said.</p>



<p>When men start testosterone therapy, it is typically given in a gel with a dose of 50-100 mg a day.</p>



<p>Women, on the other hand, are recommended to take just 5 mg a day — 10% of the dose of a man.</p>



<p>Higher doses for women can cause side effects including acne, excessive body hair and even body odor. Some are permanent.</p>



<p>Voedisch recalls one patient who finally stopped testosterone therapy after her voice was altered.</p>



<p>“She said, ‘What really did it for me was once I was on the phone and somebody called me ‘sir,’” said Voedisch.</p>



<p>Voedisch warned about side effects from improper dosing. “It may not get better even once you stop, which is really unfortunate.”</p>



<p>She’s sympathetic to patients who feel ignored by doctors and are frustrated with the lack of treatment options available for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/non-hormonal-menopause-drugs-symptoms-insurance-hurdles-rcna152439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms</a>.</p>



<p>“We have ignored women’s health for a very long time in this country,” said Voedisch. “This comes from a place of frustration and it comes from a place of wanting to feel better.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>We usually think of COVID-19 as a viral illness that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/new-xec-covid-variant-symptoms-rcna171502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">causes respiratory symptoms</a>, like congestion, sore throat and a cough. But, like a surprising amount of other viruses, the coronavirus can also lead to annoying, itchy and even painful skin rashes.</p>



<p>When you see a rash as part of a virus, you&#8217;re not really seeing the virus go into your skin directly, Dr. Andrew Walls, assistant professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School, tells TODAY.com.</p>



<p>Instead, what you&#8217;re usually seeing &#8220;is the virus activating your immune system to a high degree as it&#8217;s combating the virus,&#8221; he explains. While it&#8217;s not a common symptom of COVID, a rash is yet another manifestation of your body&#8217;s overall immune response to the virus.</p>



<p>And viral rashes aren&#8217;t unique to COVID-19; other viral illnesses such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/measles-rash-images-rcna142421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">measles</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/chicken-pox-skin-disorder-information-t186531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chickenpox</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/hand-foot-mouth-disease-symptoms-causes-treatments-t136978" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hand, foot and mouth disease</a>&nbsp;frequently include a rash.</p>



<p>A rash related to a viral infection is sometimes called a viral exanthem, Dr. Jeffery Gehlhausen, Ph.D., assistant professor of dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com. And the term encompasses an entire category of well-known skin conditions. &#8220;This (link) is something that we&#8217;ve known about for, honestly, centuries,&#8221; Gehlhausen says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-02/hives-mc-240212-fc33fb.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="COVID skin rashes" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hives are an itchy skin rash that can appear near the end of a viral infection. (Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>So, if you develop a rash as a symptom of COVID-19, you certainly aren&#8217;t the first. Here&#8217;s what to expect —&nbsp;and when to talk to your doctor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">COVID skin rashes</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hives</h3>



<p>Hives, also called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/hives-skin-disorder-information-t186231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urticaria</a>, can be related to allergies. But they also appear after a viral infection, including COVID-19.</p>



<p>The condition can present as raised, itchy red, pink or flesh-colored bumps. They can occur in isolated patches or large clusters. And they can appear pretty much anywhere on the body, including your back, chest, legs and face, Walls says.</p>



<p>Hives also &#8220;move around your body quite a bit,&#8221; Walls says. You could have hives for several days, but the patch of hives may move from area to area, he adds.</p>



<p>When hives are related to a virus, they tend to show up near the end of your infection, Walls says. The timing typically goes like this: Someone feels pretty sick and develops a fever. Then, when the fever breaks and it seems like they&#8217;re turning a corner, that&#8217;s when the rash starts to show up, Walls says.</p>



<p>Hives on their own or even with COVID-19 are not necessarily worrying, Gehlhausen says. If your hives require treatment, the first-line option is antihistamines, he explains.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/COVID-skin-rashes-zz-241029-03-66648e.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="COVID skin rashes" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hives are an itchy skin rash that can appear near the end of a viral infection. (Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Morbilliform rash (measles-like)</h3>



<p>A typical viral exanthem is a rash made up of smooth, raised pink dots which can collect into larger patches, Walls says. The rash tends to start on the chest or back. Then, over a few days, it spreads to the extremities. (Some people only have a small area of their body covered while others have very large areas with rash.)</p>



<p>The rash will then reach a peak and “kind of fade away and peel, almost like a sunburn,” Walls says. For some, the rash is completely asymptomatic. But for others, it&#8217;s very itchy, he adds.</p>



<p>One specific type of viral exanthem that dermatologists have seen with COVID is a morbilliform rash, meaning a measles-like rash. Measles rashes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/measles-rash-images-rcna142421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tend to look like small raised bumps</a>&nbsp;that eventually coalesce into larger rashes, which can affect much of the body, before gradually fading away, as TODAY.com explained previously.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Coxsackie-like rash</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/COVID-skin-rashes-zz-241029-04-94e126.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="COVID skin rashes" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Detail of foot with chilblains. (Matias Fabbri / Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dermatologists have also seen COVID-related rashes that resemble those&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/skin-beauty/skin-rash-pictures-rcna137263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused by the Coxsackie virus</a>, also called hand, foot and mouth disease.</p>



<p>&#8220;These are fixed, small, painful, sometimes itchy oval blisters that develop on the hands, feet and the inside of the mouth,&#8221; Walls explains, &#8220;often without a whole lot of rash elsewhere.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, this is an &#8220;uncommon skin manifestation for COVID,&#8221; Walls adds.</p>



<p>More recently, some strains of the Coxsackie virus have caused &#8220;more unusual rashes that may affect a larger body surface area,&#8221; Gehlhausen says. In other cases, the rash may affect less common areas, like just appearing on the buttocks, he adds.</p>



<p>&#8220;Obviously, COVID has evolved over time,&#8221; Gehlhausen says, &#8220;so you may see different distributions of the rash as a result of that.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">COVID toes</h3>



<p>You may remember a lot of talk about &#8220;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/skin-symptoms-related-coronavirus-doctors-discuss-covid-toes-t178991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID toes</a>&#8221; early on in the pandemic. But it&#8217;s not something dermatologists see a lot of these days, the experts say.</p>



<p>Chilblains —&nbsp;the technical term for COVID toes —&nbsp;is a skin condition that seemed uniquely linked to COVID and not to other viruses, Walls explains. &#8220;Sometimes it was linked to autoimmune diseases &#8230; and it was thought to be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/covid-toes-update-analysis-finds-symptoms-could-last-months-t196596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">associated with cold exposure</a>,&#8221; he adds.</p>



<p>The condition causes small areas of skin on the feet and hands to become swollen, itchy and painful, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chilblains/symptoms-causes/syc-20351097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;says. The affected areas may also blister and become temporarily discolored.</p>



<p>Today, experts don&#8217;t see COVID toes very often, they tell TODAY.com. That could be because people have stopped reporting it, the virus has mutated and is no longer causing the issue, or there was never a link to begin.</p>



<p>For now, &#8220;researchers are still looking at whether the swollen, discolored toes are caused by COVID-19,&#8221; the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/covid-toes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Academy of Dermatology</a>&nbsp;says. &#8220;It’s possible that COVID toes develop when the person’s immune system reacts to the virus that causes COVID-19.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Vasculitis</h3>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/COVID-skin-rashes-zz-241029-01-06fb1f.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="COVID skin rashes" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cutaneous vasculitis is a vascular rash that can be caused by COVID-19. (Jodi Jacobson / Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Vasculitis is an autoimmune condition caused by inflammation of the blood vessels, an it can present as a rash.</p>



<p>Experts have seen some cases of vasculitis with COVID-19, particularly small cell vasculitis, which is the &#8220;least destructive&#8221; version of the condition, Walls says.</p>



<p>We know that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the cardiovascular system and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/covid-blood-clots-warning-signs-rcna70086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make blood clots more likely</a>, Gehlhausen says, so it&#8217;s not surprising that we see vascular rashes in some patients. Generally, he says, vasculitis-type rashes occur in people with more severe infections.</p>



<p>Small cell vasculitis has been linked to many other conditions as well, including bacterial infections (even strep throat) as well as antibiotics and other medications, Walls says. &#8220;A huge array of things have triggered small vessel vasculitis in people,&#8221; he explains.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the condition typically appears as a single episode that fades away on its own. But some people have cases that linger for months or recur down the line, Walls says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can COVID trigger or exacerbate other skin issues?</h2>



<p>In addition to causing skin rashes, COVID-19 infections can also exacerbate or trigger a recurrence of pre-existing skin issues you may have.</p>



<p>That includes chronic skin conditions like psoriasis and eczema, the experts say. Interestingly, these can also flare after a COVID-19 vaccine, Gehlhausen says.</p>



<p>Illnesses, including COVID, are also known to trigger conditions such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/ali-fedotowsky-diagnosed-shingles-age-36-i-didn-t-even-t227002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shingles</a>&nbsp;and cold sores due to HSV (herpes simplex virus), Walls says. These conditions &#8220;like to reactivate when something else is running you down anyway,&#8221; he explains, which could be not getting enough sleep, stress in your personal or professional life or another illness, like COVID.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">COVID skin rashes in children</h2>



<p>Kids can get skin rashes due to viral infections, including COVID-19. In fact, children are &#8220;a little more prone to these skin reactions with viruses than adults are,&#8221; Walls explains.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kids who are experiencing these viruses for the first time are going to be prone to getting these sort of things,&#8221; Gehlhausen explains. For instance, dermatologists see a lot of kids with various forms of hives-like rashes, such as urticaria multiforme, alongside a viral infection, he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to see a doctor for COVID skin rashes</h2>



<p>&#8220;If you have a rash and COVID, it is absolutely worthwhile to go to see your primary care physician and discuss it with them,&#8221; Gehlhausen says.</p>



<p>That said, if you have one of the more common rashes — like hives or a measles-like rash — those aren&#8217;t necessarily &#8220;anything scary or concerning,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;They&#8217;re just types of rashes we know are associated with COVID, so it wouldn&#8217;t prompt us to manage the virus any differently.&#8221;</p>



<p>And, if it&#8217;s on the milder end, you may be able to treat it at home with over-the-counter antihistamines or pain medication.</p>



<p>If your rash is severe, covers a large area of your body or is especially painful or itchy, you should&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/skin-beauty/skin-rash-pictures-rcna137263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely check in with a doctor or dermatologist</a>, Walls says. They may be able to prescribe medications, like topical antihistamines or steroids, to help your skin heal.</p>



<p>The other concerning scenario is if you are generally feeling very unwell along with the rash. For instance, if you have a bad headache, high fever and trouble breathing and a rash shows up, Walls recommends checking in with a health professional.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Fluoride — long heralded as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century — could be removed from public water systems under the influence of one of President-elect Donald Trump’s advisers, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>



<p>Kennedy — who has no training in either medicine or dentistry — called fluoride “an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss” and other problems on the&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1852812012478398923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media platform X</a>.</p>



<p>“I think fluoride is on the way out,” Kennedy said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-win-rfk-jr-says-wont-take-away-anybodys-vaccines-rcna178955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wednesday on MSNBC</a>. “The faster that it goes out, the better.”</p>



<p>Whether to add fluoride to water supplies is decided and funded by local jurisdictions, not the federal government. Still, Kennedy said that if tapped, he would advise communities on fluoridated water.</p>



<p>Dentists who care for kids’ oral health say the end of fluoridated drinking water would be detrimental.</p>



<p>“It won’t happen right away, but as children continue to grow and develop, they will have an increased cavity rate,” said Dr. Meg Lochary, a pediatric dentist in Waxhaw, North Carolina,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/science-says-fluoride-water-good-kids-so-why-are-these-n920851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an area that recently opted out of adding fluoride to water systems</a>. “We will eventually see an increase in tooth decay.”</p>



<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C</a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enters for&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">D</a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isease&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C</a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ontrol and Prevention</a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">, fluoride exposure</a>&nbsp;through municipal water supplies is especially important for families who don&#8217;t have dental care.</p>



<p>While an estimated 75% of Americans have fluoridated drinking water,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fluoride-safe-drinking-water-cities-ban-rcna143605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of U.S. communities</a>&nbsp;are increasingly opting out of water fluoridation.</p>



<p>Caught in the middle are parents trying to make sense of widely differing views on added fluoride. Is it good? Is it bad? Let’s break it down.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>What are the benefits of fluoride?</strong></h2>



<p>Mouths teem with bacteria, which produce acid in saliva. Those acids weaken teeth and lead to decay. Fluoride counters that process with a one-two punch, by reducing acid and strengthening enamel, the tooth’s protective outer layer.</p>



<p>The phenomenon was discovered in the early 1900s among residents of Colorado Springs, Colorado. Tooth decay was nearly nonexistent in the population. The only thing to explain it was their drinking water, which was naturally high in fluoride that leached from local rocks and soil.</p>



<p>Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first community in the world to add fluoride to its water supply in 1945. Within a decade, cavities among young children in the town&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/fluoride/the-story-of-fluoridation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plummeted by 60%</a>.&nbsp;Other public water systems followed.</p>



<p>Major public health groups, including the<a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/community-initiatives/fluoride-in-water" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;American Dental Association</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/oral-health/fluoridation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056796.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDC</a>, soon supported the use of fluoridated water. All cite studies that show it reduces tooth decay by 25%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cavity prevention, experts say, is a major public health coup.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/tooth-decay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uncontrolled tooth decay</a>&nbsp;can lead to infections, loss of teeth and painful abscesses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Are there risks from fluoride?</h2>



<p>Despite decades of study and real-world evidence of its benefits, fluoride continues to be scrutinized.</p>



<p>To date, there&#8217;s no damning evidence proving that fluoridated water leads to any of the outcomes Kennedy mentioned, including loss of intellect.</p>



<p>“There’s not any evidence that fluoride has lowered the IQ of kids,” said Dr. David Margolius, Cleveland’s director of public health.</p>



<p>There are some small studies, however, worth mentioning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fluoride-pregnancy-kids-development-study-link-rcna152827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research published in May</a>&nbsp;suggested that fluoride exposure during pregnancy could be linked to neurobehavioral issues in kids. The study’s authors, however, said that based on the findings, it&#8217;s premature to stop adding the cavity-fighting mineral to drinking water.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 2019 study, published in&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2748634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JAMA Pediatrics</a>, found that IQ levels were slightly lower in 3- and 4-year-old children whose mothers had higher measures of fluoride in their urine when they were pregnant.</p>



<p>While the researchers said it may be time to “hit pause” on water fluoridation, they stopped short of saying the mineral should be pulled from water supplies.</p>



<p>In September,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/fluoridated-water-risk-children-epa-review-judge-rcna172775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a federal judge in California ruled</a>&nbsp;that even though he couldn’t conclude with certainty that fluoridated water was a danger to public health, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should strengthen water fluoridation regulations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>What should parents do?</strong></h2>



<p>Experts maintain that there’s no credible evidence proving fluoride has lowered kids’ IQ levels.</p>



<p>With science in mind, parents should be able to ask questions about what their kids are consuming, said Dr. Richard Besser, former acting CDC director and current president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.</p>



<p>“Any parent should feel very comfortable asking their child’s doctor, ‘What should be my approach to fluoride to protect my child’s teeth?’” Besser said. “Those are appropriate questions, but saying that fluoride doesn’t have value flies in the face of the science and evidence.”</p>

<p>A major&nbsp;<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report released</a>&nbsp;this week found that compared with abstaining from alcohol, moderate drinking was linked to a lower risk of death from any cause and a lower risk of death from heart disease, but it was also linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.</p>



<p>Far from settling the debate over whether&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/drinking-alcohol-risks-supposed-benefits-rcna98759" target="_blank">drinking in moderation is healthy or dangerous</a>, the report’s conclusions further&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/drinking-moderately-not-healthier-than-abstaining-rcna77604" target="_blank">muddied the issue</a>.</p>



<p>The report, released Tuesday, was commissioned by Congress and carried out by a committee from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. An update to federal dietary guidelines next year could include new recommendations about how much alcohol people should drink.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current guidelines&nbsp;</a>recommend people limit alcoholic beverages and say that if they choose to drink, they should do so in moderation, defined as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over the last few years, mounting evidence has questioned the health benefits of drinking. In 2022, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;concluded that no amount of alcohol is safe. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aacr.org/about-the-aacr/newsroom/news-releases/aacr-cancer-progress-report-highlights-innovative-research-novel-treatments-and-powerful-patient-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large report</a>&nbsp;this year found that heavy drinking is linked to six cancers, including cancers of the head and neck, the esophagus, the liver and the stomach.</p>



<p>For the report, the committee reviewed research dating to 2010 to look at the relationship between moderate drinking and a number of outcomes, including death from any cause, death from heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, weight changes and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>



<div style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%" class="wp-block-embed is-type-video"><iframe class="wp-block-embed is-type-video" src="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/embedded-video/mmvo207945797633" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="yes"></iframe></div>



<p>“We looked at that body of literature and were able to make three conclusions with what we call moderate certainty, and what that means is that we feel comfortable in making these conclusions based on the evidence we had available,” said Dr. Ned Calonge, chair of the NASEM committee.</p>



<p>Calonge and his team stopped short of linking moderate drinking to colorectal cancer, saying there is insufficient evidence to make a firm conclusion, though that could change in the future with more research.</p>



<p>Dr. Michael Siegel, a Tufts University public health and community medicine professor, said the cancer connection should be the main takeaway from the new report.</p>



<p>“Essentially, what this means is that alcohol is clearly a carcinogen,” Siegel said. “There isn’t a level of moderate or light drinking that can be recommended to people, because at that level it will increase their cancer risk.”</p>



<p>Dr. Michael Pignone, a professor of medicine at Duke University, said that he hasn’t seen enough evidence to tell people to stop drinking but that they shouldn’t start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am skeptical that low levels of alcohol consumption really reduce mortality or cardiovascular mortality,” Pignone said. “I would not recommend someone start drinking for health benefits.”</p>



<p>A second report conducted by a group within the Department of Health and Human Services to be published in the coming weeks will also help inform the 2025 guidelines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think this report sort of highlights all the things that we don’t know,” said Dr. Nicholas Lim, a hepatologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School, adding he hopes it will prompt better research to clarify understanding of alcohol and health.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A world-renowned team at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia performed fetal surgery to remove a tumor on the lining of an unborn baby girl’s heart. Months later, she is healthy, thriving, and at home with her family. </p>



<p>In December 2023, Brailey and Louis Valenzuela from Tennessee went for their 24-week ultrasound and received devasting news that their unborn daughter,  Arley, had a pericardial teratoma, a life-threatening tumor that develops inside the sac surrounding the heart that is typically fatal if it continues to grow and is not removed.</p>



<p>In an effort to save their baby girl&#8217;s life, the couple took a trip to Philadelphia to meet with experts from CHOP&#8217;s Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment and Fetal Heart Program for a full evaluation. </p>



<p>Less than 24 hours later, Brailey became the fourth patient at CHOP to successfully undergo this type of fetal heart surgery. </p>







<p>The surgical team included lead fetal surgeon, Holly Hedrick, MD; maternal-fetal medicine specialist, Juliana Sanchez Gebb, MD; attending pediatric cardiologist and Director of CHOP’s Fetal Heart Program, Jack Rychik, MD; and pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon, Katsuhide Maeda, MD, PhD.</p>



<p>“Fetal surgery is a well-orchestrated dance,” said Hedrick. “Every decision the team makes is informed by decades of experience.”</p>



<p>Three months after the surgery, on Feb. 17, 2024, Arley was born via c-section in CHOP’s Garbose Family Special Delivery Unit, the world’s first birth facility in a pediatric hospital specifically designed for healthy mothers carrying babies with birth defects.</p>



<p>She spent three weeks in CHOP&#8217;s Harriet and Ronald Lassin Newborn/Infant Intensive Care Unit before going home to Tennessee.</p>



<p>Today, Arley is eight months old and thriving at home with her parents and sister.</p>

<p>“When I went to medical school, it was unimaginable that we&#8217;d be able to safely enter and exit the womb, perform surgery on a fetus and achieve a successful outcome,” said Rychik. &#8220;Each one of these families is a pioneer and I have every expectation that Arley will grow into a healthy child with every opportunity to live a happy and productive life.”</p>



<p>To date, CHOP has performed more than 1,629 fetal surgeries, more than any other hospital in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every year, DART partners with the Food Bank of Delaware for our annual &#8216;Stuff The Bus&#8217; Thanksgiving Food Drive,&#8221; DART said. &#8220;DART strives to collect a substantial amount of non-perishable food items to help Delawareans in need of food assistance.&#8221;</p>







<p>Other stops of the Thanksgiving food drive include stores in Dover, Newark, Stanton and Wilmington, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fbd.org/dart-stuff-the-bus/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.fbd.org/dart-stuff-the-bus/" target="_blank">according to the Food Bank of Delaware</a>. Each day food will be collected from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>



<p>The goal for 2024 is to collect around 20,000 pounds of food, organizers said. The food bank will ensure the donated food filters down through its 745 &#8220;hunger relief partners&#8221; to feed those who are dealing with food insecurity.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A South Jersey hospital now gives parents a new way to connect with their babies in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. </p>



<p>Families at <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.inspirahealthnetwork.org/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!tra9t0Z2esvs2TCOoq44JoO20P5hOGBmkKfCM5IojsfMIBBPjN8Jq_MqqxVfY2CIGI7kqbktMTziwR83$">Inspira Medical Center Vineland</a> can now use the hospital&#8217;s 24/7 camera system to monitor their newborns whenever they want, day or night, from virtually anywhere. </p>



<p>The AngelEye Health Camera System, which was recently installed at the Deborah F. Sager NICU, was made possible by a donation from Robert Buono, Sr., to the Deborah F. Sager Memorial Fund. </p>



<p>This technology is HIPAA-compliant, and now families can securely watch their newborn babies on their smartphone, tablet, PC, or even large-screen television at their convenience. </p>

<p>In late September, Inspira Medical Center Vineland became the first hospital in southern New Jersey to offer this technology to its NICU families. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are so grateful to Bob and the entire Buono family who generously funded this project in memory of their beloved Rosemary,&#8221; said Robin Walton, Senior Vice President of External Affairs and Chief Philanthropy Officer for Inspira Health. &#8220;Their gift will touch the hearts of NICU families every day by allowing parents and other loved ones to have the reassurance and comfort of seeing their little baby anytime they wish.&#8221;</p>



<p>A total of 16 cameras have been installed, and to date, every family has consented to utilizing the technology since.  </p>



<p>&#8220;Being able to provide our families with a window into our NICU can be a great source of comfort to them,&#8221; said Dawn Goffredo, Assistant Vice President of Maternal Child Health for Inspira Health. &#8220;Our moms and dads wish they could spend every moment at their baby&#8217;s side, but that&#8217;s not realistic for most families. The camera system is also a blessing for grandparents, siblings and other loved ones who might live out of state or be unable to visit our NICU.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Attorney General Michelle Henry filed a lawsuit against Prospect Medical Holdings, accusing the health care company of mismanaging and neglecting the Crozer Health System, leading to the closures of two hospitals in Delaware County.</p>



<p>The lawsuit – filed on Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2024, &#8212; accuses Prospect Medical of breaking the 2016 Asset Purchases Agreement by cutting services and closing facilities while diverting funds to private shareholders and investors instead of supporting the health care network. The civil complaint required the company to fund operating costs until a new owner is in place.</p>



<p>“The lawsuit is also seeking a preliminary injunction to preserve existing service lines, the appointment of a receiver to manage the Crozer Health System for the immediate future to avoid additional closures and cuts to services,” a spokesperson for the Attorney General’s Office wrote.</p>







<p>The Attorney General’s Office said they had initial concerns about the 2016 purchase but agreed to it after “certain conditions of sale” were included in the court order. The purchase agreement included keeping all acute care</p>



<p>“We are taking legal action against a company which agreed to prioritize affordable, accessible healthcare — but instead broke their promise with years of neglectful, self-serving practices that have put lives at risk,” Attorney General Henry said. “My office is the last line of defense for Pennsylvanians who are losing quality, convenient healthcare due to corporate greed. We had no choice but to file suit as Prospect Medical’s conduct will almost certainly result in future closures that will force patients to travel distances for emergency care.”</p>



<p>The initial purchase agreements included keeping all acute care hospitals open for at least 10 years, Henry said. The lawsuit accuses Prospect Medical of mismanaging and diverting more than $450 million to private investors through “sophisticated financial transactions,” including real estate sale-lease agreements of hospital assets. The mismanagement led to the closures of Delaware County Memorial Hospital and Springfield Hospital as well as suspensions of related health care services, according to Henry.</p>



<p>While Crozer-Chester Medical Center and Taylor Hospital remain open, Prospect Medical anticipated suspensions of trauma, burn, maternal child services and women’s health services at Crozer-Chester, Henry said.</p>



<p>Crozer-Chester and Taylor Hospital both provide services to more than 500 patients each day on average.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Prospect Medical released a statement in response to the lawsuit, calling it “hasty, ill-considered, and complete unnecessary.”</p>

<p>More than 8 million people were diagnosed with tuberculosis last year, <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/world-health-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the World Health Organization</a> said Tuesday, the highest number recorded since the U.N. health agency began keeping track.</p>



<p>About 1.25 million people died of TB last year, the new report said, adding that TB likely returned to being the world’s top infectious disease killer after being replaced by <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 during the pandemic.</a> The deaths are almost double the number of people killed by HIV in 2023. </p>



<p>WHO said TB continues to mostly affect people in Southeast Asia, Africa and the Western Pacific; India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines and Pakistan account for more than half of the world&#8217;s cases. </p>



<p>“The fact that TB still kills and sickens so many people is an outrage, when we have the tools to prevent it, detect it and treat it,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. </p>



<p>TB deaths continue to fall globally, however, and the number of people being newly infected is beginning to stabilize. The agency noted that of the 400,000 people estimated to have drug-resistant TB last year, fewer than half were diagnosed and treated. </p>



<p>Tuberculosis is caused by airborne bacteria that mostly affects the lungs. Roughly a quarter of the global population is estimated to have TB, but only about 5–10% of those develop symptoms.</p>



<p>Advocacy groups, including Doctors Without Borders, have long called for the U.S. company Cepheid, which produces TB tests used in poorer countries, to make them available for $5 per test to increase availability. Earlier this month, Doctors Without Borders and 150 global health partners sent Cepheid an open letter calling on them to “prioritize people&#8217;s lives” and to urgently help make TB testing more widespread globally. </p>

<p>Burger King, Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut have all pulled onions from a portion of their restaurants following reports of a “severe”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-cdc-rcna176695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement sent to TODAY.com Thursday, Oct. 24, a Burger King spokesperson said, “We have reviewed our restaurant supply given recent announcements. There is no crossover with McDonald’s for the vast majority of our onion facilities.”</p>



<p>But, the spokesperson added, “About 5% of our restaurants do receive onions distributed from the Taylor Farms Colorado facility.”</p>



<p>Burger King said that its restaurant “only uses whole, fresh onions” and that employees cut, peel, wash and slice them daily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Despite no contact from health authorities and no indications of illness, we proactively asked our 5% of restaurants who received whole onions distributed by this facility to dispose of them immediately two days ago and we are in the process of restocking them from other facilities,” the statement concluded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Yum! Brands spokesperson also confirmed in a statement to TODAY.com that onions were removed from some of its Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC locations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As we continue to monitor the recently reported E. coli outbreak, and out of an abundance of caution, we have proactively removed fresh onions from select Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC restaurants,” the spokesperson said. “We will continue following supplier and regulatory guidance to ensure the ongoing safety and quality of our food.”</p>



<p>TODAY.com has reached out to Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC for a statement, as well.</p>



<p>The removal comes two days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first announced in a food safety&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/outbreaks/e-coli-O157.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alert</a>&nbsp;on its website that there was an E. coli outbreak across multiple states linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time, the CDC said investigators were trying to determine which food ingredient caused the contamination and that McDonald’s “stopped using fresh slivered onions and quarter pound beef patties in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/news/mcdonalds-e-coli-outbreak-states-rcna176772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several states</a>.”</p>



<p>Supplier U.S. Foods announced Oct. 23 that Taylor Farms had issued a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Recall-Details-8685-TAYLOR-FARMS-Recall-of-Onions-2024_10_22.pdf" target="_blank">recall notification</a>&nbsp;for yellow jumbo peeled, diced and whole peeled onions “due to potential E. coli contamination.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>TODAY.com has reached out to Taylor Farms for a statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An FDA spokesperson told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-mcdonalds-e-coli-onions-farms-source-rcna177007" target="_blank">NBC News</a>&nbsp;Oct. 24 that it was looking into the supplier as the potential source of the recent outbreak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re looking at all possible sources,” the FDA said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CDC has reported 49 cases and 10 hospitalizations due the outbreak. One death has also been reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an update shared Oct. 23, the CDC said that McDonald’s removed slivered onions and beef patties from some locations in the following states: Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma and parts of Idaho.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joe Erlinger, the president of McDonald’s USA, spoke about the E. coli contamination while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/food/news/mcdonalds-president-e-coli-outbreak-rcna176743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appearing on TODAY Oct. 23</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are very confident that you can go to McDonald’s and enjoy our classics,” he said. “We took swift action yesterday to remove the Quarter Pounder from our menu.”</p>



<p>He later added, “This is something that we talk about as being everyone’s business. And so while the investigation continues, and we’ll continue to get into the details of those investigations, I don’t think that’s what’s important. What’s important today is that we’ve taken the action to protect the American public and promote public health.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said that the company is working with the CDC as the organization continues to investigate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-releases-blood-test-results-missouri-bird-flu-patient-cases-spread-rcna175456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The bird flu virus </a>hasn’t yet spread from person to person, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday, releasing findings from a monthslong probe into a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-infected-bird-flu-missouri-no-contact-animals-know-rcna170010" target="_blank">patient in Missouri who was hospitalized with H5N1</a>.</p>



<p>The patient, who tested positive for bird flu in August, had no known contact with dairy cows or poultry. H5N1, or bird flu, has been spreading among farm animals, wild birds and other animals and has infected 31 people, mostly farmworkers, in the U.S.</p>



<p>After the Missouri patient fell ill, several close contacts reported respiratory symptoms and health officials conducted serologic, or blood, tests to determine if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-says-no-clear-source-bird-flu-infection-missouri-patient-rcna170871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the virus had spread among them</a>. Test results on five health care workers who became ill after caring for the patient came back negative for any sign of the virus, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who heads the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a media briefing.</p>



<p>“From the perspective of where we are with this investigation, I think we’ve got the conclusion,” Daskalakis said.</p>



<p>One blood test on a household member of the patient who became ill suggested the person did have H5 antibodies. A second test was unable to confirm the finding.</p>

<p>An additional look at the cases gave investigators confidence that the patient did not make the household contact sick.</p>



<p>It appears that the two people became sick at the same time from the same source — likely some kind of animal or animal product, the CDC said. Both people developed symptoms, which were mostly gastrointestinal, simultaneously.</p>



<p>“We arrived at the same conclusion using different lines of evidence as it relates to person-to-person transmission,” said Dr. Nirav Shah, the CDC&#8217;s principal deputy director. All of the people who fell ill have since recovered.</p>



<p>It’s reassuring news indicating the virus hasn’t mutated in ways that would allow it to spread easily between people.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bird-flu-cases-humans-reported-6-states-washington-rcna176482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virus is continuing to spread</a>&nbsp;from infected birds and cows to people, however.</p>



<p>While CDC officials maintained that the risk of bird flu in the general population is low, people who work directly with wildlife and farm animals are more likely to become infected.</p>



<p>The bird flu outbreak in dairy cows has infected<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html" target="_blank">&nbsp;333 herds across 14 states</a>&nbsp;so far.</p>



<p>Most of the people who have gotten sick are linked to dairy cows.</p>



<p>Two workers who were culling chickens at a poultry farm in Washington recently became ill. That number is expected to rise, prompting Washington state to invite a CDC team to help with the investigation.</p>



<p>“Folks on the ground in Washington are doing investigations. Their lab may be running samples. Our lab is running samples,” Shah said. “This is a fast-moving situation.”</p>



<p>California, which has reported the largest number of bird flu cases, 15, has also asked for federal help, the CDC said.</p>



<p>Dr. Erica Pan, deputy director for the California Department of Public Health’s Center for Infectious Diseases, said the agency and local health departments are reaching out to workers at farms with H5N1 in animals “on a daily basis.”</p>



<p>“These are proactive health checks,” Pan said. “It’s about actually checking with them, ‘How are you doing? Are you having symptoms?’”</p>



<p>People who have been infected with bird flu have generally had mild symptoms, mainly redness and discharge from the eyes, as well as some reports of upper respiratory illness.</p>



<p>Other states that have reported human H5N1 cases are Colorado, Michigan and Texas.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>U.S. health officials on Wednesday recommended that people 50 and older get a shot against bacteria that can cause pneumonia and other dangerous illnesses.</p>



<p>The recommendation was made by a scientific advisory panel and then accepted by the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The decision lowered — from 65 — the minimum recommended age for older adults to get the shot.</p>



<p>“Now is a great time to get vaccinated against pneumococcal disease in preparation for the winter respiratory season,” CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said in a statement Wednesday night.</p>



<p>The advisory committee voted 14-1 to make the change during a meeting earlier in the day in Atlanta. The guidance is widely heeded by doctors and prompts health insurers to pay for recommended shots.</p>



<p>Pneumococcal shot recommendations are sometimes called the most complicated vaccination guidance that the government issues. The CDC currently recommends shots for children younger than 5 and adults 65 or older, as long as they have never been vaccinated against pneumococcal disease. Officials also recommend the shots for children and adults at increased risk for pneumococcal disease, such as those with diabetes, chronic liver disease or a weakened immune system.</p>



<p>There are more than 100 known types of pneumococci bacteria, which can cause serious infections in the lungs and other parts of the body. Each year, the U.S. sees roughly 30,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease, which includes blood infections, brain and spine inflammation, pneumonia, meningitis and other illnesses. About 30% of cases are among 50- to 64-year-olds.</p>



<p>The first pneumococcal vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1977, and since then pharmaceutical companies have been coming up with newer versions that target a dozen or more types in a single shot. Different vaccines have fallen in and out of favor, including Pfizer’s Prevnar 13, which was once a top-seller but is no longer available.</p>



<p>There are four vaccines now in use. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/money-report/fda-approves-merck-vaccine-designed-to-protect-adults-from-bacteria-that-can-cause-pneumonia-serious-infections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approved the newest — Merck’s Capvaxive</a>, which can cost around $300 a dose and protects against 21 types, including eight not included in other pneumococcal vaccines. A Merck spokesperson said it was specifically designed to help protect against the bacteria types that cause the majority of severe disease in adults aged 50 and older.</p>



<p>The CDC advisory panel in June recommended the vaccine as an option for adults at higher risk. At the time, the committee also talked about the possibility of lowering the age recommendation for older adults. They noted that illness-causing infections peak at age 55 to 59 in Black Americans — a lower age than what’s seen in white people. But the committee put off that decision until this week&#8217;s meeting.</p>



<p>Some concerns: A booster shot may prove to be necessary, perhaps in about 15 years. And there are some new vaccines in development that could force another update to the recommendations.</p>



<p>“Pneumococcal has been a very confusing recommendation for many, many years and it’s hard to have a new recommendation every two or three years,” said Dr. Jamie Loehr, chair of the committee’s pneumococcal working group. He was the only person to vote against the proposal.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/fda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> has recalled thousands of bottles of the antidepressant duloxetine over the presence of a toxic chemical.</p>



<p><a href="http://accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/?Product=210449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to an Oct. 10 notice</a> from the agency, the recall involves 7,107 bottles of duloxetine, which is sold under the brand name Cymbalta. Duloxetine is part of a class of drugs called selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which are used to treat depression, anxiety and other mood disorders, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/duloxetine-marketed-cymbalta-information" target="_blank">according to the FDA</a>.</p>



<p>The FDA issued the recall due to the presence of N-nitroso-duloxetine above the proposed interim limit. N-nitroso-duloxetine is toxic if swallowed and suspected of causing cancer, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/N-Nitroso-Duloxetine#datasheet=LCSS" target="_blank">according to the National Library of Medicine</a>.</p>



<p>The recalled capsules are 20mg in strength and sold in 500-count bottles. The lot number for the recalled products is 220128 with an expiration date of December 2024 and manufactured by Towa Pharmaceutical Europe, according to the FDA.</p>



<p>The recall is designated as a Class II, meaning the product &#8220;may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote,&#8221; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/postmarket-requirements-devices/recalls-corrections-and-removals-devices#:~:text=Class%20II%20%2D%20a%20situation%20in,adverse%20health%20consequences%20is%20remote." target="_blank">according to the FDA</a>.</p>



<p>N-nitroso-duloxetine is a chemical compound that can increase the risk cancer if consumed at elevated concentrations, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/what-know-and-do-about-possible-nitrosamines-your-medication#:~:text=Nitrosamines%20are%20organic%20compounds%20that,form%20in%20drugs%20during%20manufacturing." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the FDA</a>.</p>



<p>The FDA did not issue specific guidance on what to do with the recalled duloxetine. Patients who take this medication should contact their health care provider. </p>

<p>Four new cases of avian influenza were detected in farmworkers in Washington state this week, the latest in a drumbeat of human infections cropping up across the U.S. as the virus continues to <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/scientist-hunt-for-answers-bird-flu-outbreak-in-cows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spread among farm animals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Washington is the sixth state to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bird-flu-suspected-four-washington-farm-workers-cdc-sends-team-rcna176534" target="_blank">report human cases of bird flu</a>, which has spread rampantly in wild birds, poultry and cattle. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assuming the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> confirms the state’s positive tests, they will bring the U.S. tally to at least 31.</p>



<p>Flu experts said the risk of a broader outbreak among humans will continue to simmer if the virus remains uncontrolled in animals.</p>



<p>“The longer this virus hangs out in the environment, the more animals it spills over into, the more it changes in ways we don’t understand or predict, the more concerned we are going to be that this becomes the next global pandemic,” said Dr. Amber Itle, the Washington state veterinarian.</p>







<p>For now, however, health officials maintain that the virus has not made key genetic changes that would allow it to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bird-flu-spreading-people-blood-test-results-officials-cant-say-rcna173309" target="_blank">spread between people</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is no evidence of any sustained human transmission. And that is a key milestone for all of us. It’s a key trigger for all of us. That’s when we really start to say, ‘Oh, something that’s markedly different about this virus,’” Dr. Umair Shah, Washington’s health secretary, said at a news conference Sunday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A CDC spokesperson said Tuesday morning that a federal team was being deployed to Washington and that risk to the public remained low.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the virus is a growing concern for farmworkers on the front lines. The four latest cases were among workers who had culled birds at a commercial egg farm where an outbreak of avian influenza was reported in chickens.</p>



<p>Shah said the workers were part of a contract crew tasked with depopulating — or euthanizing — all chickens at the farm in Franklin County, in southeastern Washington, which had more than 800,000 birds. Itle said the workers wore full protective equipment: suits made of Tyvek, goggles and respirators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s hot, it’s dusty. It’s a lot of birds in close proximity, and we’re getting a lot of viral exposure,” she said.</p>

<p>The four people who tested positive after that work reported mild respiratory symptoms and conjunctivitis, or pink eye — symptoms now understood to be common when people are infected. None of the workers were hospitalized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said the Washington cases represented “more of the same” in a pattern observed across the U.S. as workers tasked with culling sick animals have fallen ill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-says-second-health-care-worker-tied-missouri-bird-flu-case-symptom-rcna171262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one human case</a>&nbsp;— in Missouri — has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/cdc-bird-flu-response.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">puzzled researchers and health officials</a>, because that person&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-infected-bird-flu-missouri-no-contact-animals-know-rcna170010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did not have contact with animals</a>. It is not clear how the person was exposed, and results of further tests that could offer clues are still pending,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/cdc-bird-flu-response.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the CDC</a>.&nbsp;Six health workers exposed to the patient reported respiratory symptoms.</p>



<p>Webby said the virus’ spread in cows for the past 10 months has raised experts’ level of concern because cows are mammals and interact with humans frequently. That increases the likelihood the virus could mutate to pass from person to person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Just because it hasn’t happened in 10 months … it doesn’t mean it can’t,” said Webby,&nbsp;an infectious disease researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research suggests that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/bird-flu-efficiently-spread-between-cows-mammals-rcna163487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredible amounts of virus are shed in infected cows’ mammary glands</a>, so the virus could spread through raw milk. (Milk sold in grocery stores is pasteurized, which inactivates the virus.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, the U.S. is preparing for flu season, when circulation of common influenza viruses increases in fall and winter. If two influenza viruses share the same host, they can share genetic information and mutate more quickly.</p>



<p>“You don’t want people affected with the seasonal flu virus to get a virus from animals and for those viruses to potentially recombine,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, a professor of environmental and occupational health sciences&nbsp;at the University of Washington and the director of its Center for One Health Research.</p>



<p>Rabinowitz added that it is important to improve protection protocols for farmworkers and encourage them to get their flu shots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a wakeup call. We need to do a better job of protecting workers,” he said.</p>



<p>Itle said cases in poultry were not unexpected in Washington state, because migrating birds passed through during summer and early fall. Recently, owls and other birds of prey were found dead, suggesting some wild animals had been stricken with the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wild birds can spread the virus to farms through direct contact with poultry or livestock or via droppings, saliva or feed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 103 million birds have been sickened, killed or culled in the current bird flu outbreak, according to CDC statistics. The virus has been detected in poultry in 48 states.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The CDC says</a> 330 dairy herds have been affected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Washington has not had an outbreak among dairy producers, Itle said, but dairy farms there are now testing weekly.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Not having — or losing — your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/phantom-smells-sign-trouble-rcna62638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sense of smell&nbsp;</a>may be linked to changes in breathing that could lead to depression, social isolation or other mental and physical health problems, a new study suggests. It&#8217;s more evidence of how important this often neglected olfactory sense is.</p>



<p>A new analysis of&nbsp;breathing data from 52 volunteers over a 24-hour period revealed that people with a normal sense of smell had little spikes, or “sniffs,” during each breath that were not seen in those with no sense of smell, according to the report published in Nature Communications on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>People can be born with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/phantom-smells-may-be-more-common-thought-study-finds-n901426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no sense of smell, a condition called anosmia</a>, or they can acquire it, as has been the case with many who had<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ba5-symptoms-loss-smell-common-rcna37961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;a Covid infection</a>.</p>



<p>The volunteers in the study without the ability to detect odors were all born with the condition.</p>



<p>Nearly 1 in 4 people have anosmia, according to National Institutes of Health estimates. Experts say that number is likely an undercount.</p>



<p>A 2023 report determined that more than 60% of people<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/lary.30802" target="_blank">&nbsp;diagnosed with Covid developed anosmia</a>. About 72% of those completely regained their sense of smell, while about a quarter partially got their sense of smell back. Nearly 4% of people after Covid infection didn&#8217;t recover their ability to smell.</p>



<div style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%" class="wp-block-embed is-type-video"><iframe class="wp-block-embed is-type-video" src="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/embedded-video/mmvo167322181643" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="yes"></iframe></div>



<p>Even for those in the 4%, there may still be hope, since some get their sense of smell back as late as three years after their infection, experts say. There are treatments that may help, such as smell training or a procedure known as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/long-covid-lost-taste-smell-treatment-procedure-rcna75034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stellate ganglion block</a>.</p>



<p>The main takeaway from the study is better insight into some of the mental issues that some Covid patients who have lost their sense of smell experience, said the study’s lead author, Lior Gorodisky, a Ph.D. candidate in the brain sciences department at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The differences in breathing between those who can smell and those who can’t are pretty significant. “We are now also able to identify lifelong anosmia just based on the respiratory pattern,” Gorodisky said in an email.</p>



<p>The little inhalations during a breath, known as the “sniff response,” are something that most of us experience unconsciously every day, Gorodisky said. Those little sniffs tell our brains about good and bad smells. “When you go to a bakery or a flower field, once your brain has sensed the good smell of a pastry or a flower, you immediately take a deeper breath,” Gorodisky said.</p>



<p>To determine whether having anosmia might affect respiration, the researchers supplied the 52 volunteers with nasal devices that would monitor breathing as they went about their days.</p>



<p>Previous research has linked anosmia to a wide variety&nbsp;of negative outcomes, ranging from dulled emotions and depression to a shortened lifespan, the authors noted.</p>



<p>Although people in the study with anosmia had had it their entire lives, the researchers believe their findings will apply to others who developed the condition.</p>



<p>Losing the ability to detect odors can lead to impaired memory of events linked to specific smells, Gorodisky said. Because of that, it can take away the joy from daily activities such as eating and socializing with friends and family.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for shortened lifespans, that could be due at least in part to people not smelling odors that could indicate danger, such as smoke, Gorodisky said.</p>



<p>A<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-69772-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;study published in August</a>&nbsp;found that people who lost their sense of smell as a result of Covid had behavioral, functional and structural brain changes.</p>



<p>The number of people with smell dysfunction are &#8220;vastly underestimated, said Valentina Parma, assistant director at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia.</p>



<p>She called the new study a “very first step.”</p>



<p>“We are piecing together more reasons why we need to pay more attention to the sense of smell,” said Parma, who was not involved with the new research.</p>



<p>The value of the sense of smell is often underappreciated.</p>



<p>“For the majority of the world, smell is an afterthought,” Parma said. “Covid helped bring it into the mainstream. It was a game changer.”</p>



<p>Currently, health care providers often don’t ask about or test for anosmia, Parma said. And that needs to change since its development later in life has been linked to the start of a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/loss-smell-warning-sign-alzheimers-lose-sense-smell-covid-rcna40665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serious disorders, including Alzheimer’s&nbsp;</a>and Parkinson’s, she said.</p>



<p>The findings underscore the importance of testing for anosmia and finding treatments, said otolaryngologist Dr. Jonathan Overdevest at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers also need to work out the details of how losing one’s sense of smell might affect other aspects of health, Overdevest said. “One thing we do know is that a portion of the brain affected earliest by Alzheimer’s is in charge of the sense of smell,” he added.</p>



<p>Brain scanning studies have shown that the sense of smell connects with many aspects of thinking, said&nbsp;<a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/benjamin-tenoever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benjamin tenOever</a>, chair of the department of microbiology at the New York University Langone Medical Center in New York City.</p>



<p>If there is an odor from a noxious fume, “the neurons in the nose tell the brain that there is something dangerous to avoid,” tenOever said. “And when there is a pleasant smell, the brain tells the nose to increase the amount of air inhaled. It’s not something that’s done consciously, but instead, the brain is hardwired to do it.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;ve ventured into the relationship-oriented side of TikTok in the past year, you&#8217;ve likely encountered the concept of golden retriever boyfriends.</p>



<p>Like their adorable canine counterparts, golden retriever boyfriends are friendly, faithful, and affectionate.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re craving takeout, they&#8217;ll fetch your favorite meal without being asked. They’re not afraid to look a little bit goofy, whether they’re showering you with kisses or splashing in the pool while you work on your tan.&nbsp;They’re always thrilled to see you when you walk through the door — even if you only left an hour ago.</p>



<p>Most importantly, they&#8217;re always willing to go the extra mile for their favorite person: think Travis Kelce flying across the world to see Taylor Swift in the middle of football season, or Ryan Gosling wearing Eva Mendes&#8217; initial on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/style/celeb-style/ryan-gosling-eva-mendes-barbie-premiere-necklace-rcna93403" target="_blank">necklace</a> at the “Barbie” red carpet premiere.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2549" height="1176" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/GettyImages-1927882507.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all&#038;resize=2549%2C1176&#038;strip=all" alt="" class="wp-image-9973547" srcset="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/GettyImages-1927882507.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=2549&amp;strip=all 2549w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/GettyImages-1927882507.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300&amp;strip=all 300w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/GettyImages-1927882507.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768&amp;strip=all 768w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/GettyImages-1927882507.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1536&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/GettyImages-1927882507.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=2048&amp;strip=all 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Happy panting Golden retriever dog and blue Maine Coon looking at camera, Isolated on white.

<p>In most cases, being a golden retriever boyfriend is regarded as a green flag. After all, who wouldn’t want a loyal, attentive partner who prioritizes your needs?</p>



<p>However, there&#8217;s a lot more to the golden retriever boyfriend than meets the eye — especially if you tend to embrace the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/life/relationships/black-cat-girlfriend-tiktok-rcna171263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black cat personality type</a>.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what you should know about the golden retriever boyfriend trend and what it means for your relationship.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a golden retriever boyfriend?</h2>



<p>A golden retriever boyfriend shares many positive traits with the dog breed itself: he&#8217;s devoted, outgoing, affectionate, and always ready to have fun.</p>



<p>According to Liza Gold, LCSW, founder and director of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://goldtherapynyc.com/#/" target="_blank">Gold Therapy NYC</a>, golden retriever boyfriend traits include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Easygoing</li>



<li>Loving</li>



<li>Social</li>



<li>Eager to please</li>



<li>Devoted</li>
</ul>



<p>“They&#8217;re obviously very loyal,” Taylor Frazar-Green, M.A. LPC-A, tells TODAY.com. “I think that the biggest thing similar to the golden retriever dog is that they’re very eager to please and always very agreeable with their partner.”</p>



<p>Beyond social media trends, the golden retriever boyfriend trope has taken off in film and T.V.</p>



<p>Notable examples of golden retriever boyfriends in popular culture include Peter Parker from “Spider-Man” (specifically Tom Holland&#8217;s role), Jeremiah from “The Summer I Turned Pretty,”  Jake Peralta from “Brooklyn 99,” and of course, Travis Kelce of Kansas City Chiefs fame.</p>



<p>For Frazer-Green, the golden retriever boyfriend archetype represents a shift in what we consider ideal qualities in a male partner.</p>



<p>In contrast to the brooding charmers of days past, the golden retriever boyfriend is open, thoughtful, and affectionate.</p>



<p>Gold also feels that the golden retriever boyfriend trend represents a shift in gender roles.</p>



<p>“I think perhaps one reason why this concept has become so viral is because it has sort of a zeitgeist of empowerment for women. Like, ‘I don’t have to be the one to chase,’” Gold says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The pros and cons of a golden retriever boyfriend</h2>



<p>On the surface, the idea of a golden retriever boyfriend seems universally positive.</p>



<p>“A relationship with a golden retriever boyfriend is probably one characterized by a lot of affection, and tenderness and playfulness,” Gold says.</p>



<p>However, even the most well-behaved golden retriever boyfriends aren&#8217;t immune to red flag behavior.</p>



<p>Like their canine namesakes, golden retriever boyfriends can be high-maintenance.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re an introvert who needs time to recharge, you might struggle with the demands of a high-energy partner who always wants to spend time together.</p>



<p>“At times it can be quite draining, because I think at some point everyone needs to shut off to restore themselves,&#8221; Gold says. &#8220;I mean, play is wonderful. Affection is wonderful. But what about those moments where you’re not in the mood to be upbeat, playful or affectionate?&#8221;</p>



<p>Their devoted nature can also veer into clinginess. Still, Gold understands the allure of a golden retriever boyfriend.</p>



<p>Amidst a dating scene rife with mind games and “playing it cool,” a partner who isn’t afraid to express affection is especially appealing.</p>



<p>“It’s the idea of having a partner who shows up, who wants to put the work in to the relationship, who wants to show that he loves you and he cares about you,” Gold says. “I think those are lovely characteristics that most people would want in their partner.”</p>



<p>At the end of the day, Gold recommends asking yourself whether those idealized traits align with your real-life needs:</p>



<p>“Am I getting what I need from this person? Are they showing up for me in the ways that I need to feel good? Do I feel valued and respected by them?”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are golden retrievers and black cats compatible?</h2>



<p>In sharp contrast to the golden retriever boyfriend&#8217;s outgoing, friendly personality, a black cat girlfriend is reserved, mysterious, and occasionally aloof.</p>



<p>Despite their differences, black cat girlfriends and golden retriever boyfriends are a popular pairing — according to social media, at least.</p>



<p>However, Gold warns that you and your partner might end up fighting like cats and dogs. She links golden retriever boyfriends and black cat girlfriends to anxious attachment and avoidant attachment styles, respectively.</p>



<p>“Sometimes the relationships work out long term, sometimes they don’t,” she says. “But they are usually relationships with a fairly high degree of conflict due to opposing needs.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Contrary to popular belief, opposites don&#8217;t actually attract, after all.</p>



<p>“There’s a spate of research to support the notion that opposites don’t attract. People with similar interests attract, and people with similar personality traits attract.”</p>



<p>However, all is not lost for the black cat-golden retriever pairing. Regardless of outward appearances, the most important factor in a relationship is whether the couple&#8217;s values and traits are compatible.</p>



<p>“People are attracted to one another when they have complementary features, which can sometimes appear as ‘opposite,’” Gold says. “But they have to be opposites that complement one another, not clash.”</p>

<p>The Arizona grandmother who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/grandmother-s-accidental-thanksgiving-text-random-teen-leads-heartwarming-viral-n685586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went viral for accidentally inviting a stranger to her Thanksgiving dinner</a>&nbsp;has been diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>



<p>Wanda Dench chose to open up about her diagnosis in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, saying she&#8217;s been undergoing chemotherapy.</p>



<p>Jamal Hinton, the &#8220;stranger&#8221; she mistakenly texted eight years ago, posted her statement on X on Wednesday.</p>



<p>Dench began by describing her long-standing relationship with Hinton and how it changed their lives &#8220;for the better.&#8221;</p>



<p>She also explained how her diagnosis was discovered.</p>



<p>&#8220;Earlier this year, I came down with bronchitis and had a CT scan to check out my lungs,&#8221; Dench said in Hinton&#8217;s post. &#8220;That’s when a mass in my breast was detected and they suggested I get a mammogram and that verified I had breast cancer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dench mentioned that cancer doesn&#8217;t run in her family and that all of her previous mammograms have been negative. She believed the mammogram she received two years ago, at age 65, would be her last.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was wrong,&#8221; she said. &#8220;After the shock wore off, I met with the most wonderful people at the Breast Cancer Center. Everyone was so kind, supportive, and knowledgeable. My family and friends quickly came to my aid and have supported me through everything.&#8221;</p>



<p>One of those people is Hinton. Since Dench&#8217;s accidental Thanksgiving invitation in 2016, Hinton and Dench have spent much time together, even outside of the November holiday.</p>



<iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.today.com/today/embedded-video/mmvo155051589612' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>When Dench&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/grandma-whose-misfired-text-teen-led-thanksgiving-invite-loses-husband-n1179976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost her husband, Lonnie, in 2020 after he was diagnosed with COVID-19</a>, Hinton announced the tragedy on X.</p>



<p>&#8220;As some of you may have already found out tonight, Lonnie did not make it &#8230; he passed away Sunday morning, but Wanda told me all the love and support he was receiving put a huge smile on his face so I thank every single one of you guys for that!&#8221; he said alongside pictures and videos of him and his girlfriend with the Denches over the years.</p>



<p>Dench said in her statement that as a fan of the &#8220;Golden Bachelor,&#8221; she believes she &#8220;could still find love&#8221; in her &#8220;senior years.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So continue getting your checkups, and continue to live your YOUR life,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Fans flooded Hinton&#8217;s comments with well-wishes for Dench and expressions of appreciation for her years-long bond with Hinton.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sending love to our grandma!&#8221; one wrote. Another said, &#8220;This is one of my favorite stories around Thanksgiving!! Praying for Ms. Wanda.&#8221;</p>



<p>In 2016, Dench texted then 17-year-old Hinton inviting him to Thanksgiving dinner, thinking she was texting her grandson. After texts (and selfies) were exchanged, Dench realized her mistake, but didn&#8217;t rescind the invitation. To their many fans&#8217; delight, the pair has now been celebrating Thanksgiving together for the last eight years.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Somebody grandma is coming in clutch this year!! Ayee!!! <a href="https://t.co/QGrx83nHLl">pic.twitter.com/QGrx83nHLl</a></p>&mdash; Jamal Hinton (@Jamalhinton12) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jamalhinton12/status/798646484438687744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2016</a></blockquote> 



<p>And according to Dench, this year will be no exception.</p>



<p>&#8220;We still plan on getting together for Thanksgiving next month as we have every year,&#8221; she said.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Those snake dreams you&#8217;ve been having? They have a message and a meaning.</p>



<p>As a professional dream interpreter and the author of “The Alchemy of Your Dreams,” I help people come to insights about recurrent patterns and symbols that pop up in their dreams, like snakes.</p>



<p>All&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/dreams-why-do-we-dream-what-does-it-mean-today-t212020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dreams are gifts</a>, even the ones that scare you (see: snakes). Every night when we sleep, we are gifted with the opportunity to receive guidance, creative ideas and positive solutions through our dreams.</p>



<p>Dreams have been proven to help regulate negative emotion and offer up healing. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/dreams-why-do-we-dream-what-does-it-mean-today-t212020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous interview with TODAY.com</a>, Adriane Soehner, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh and the director of the Pitt Sleep, Affective Neuroscience, and Development Lab, said dreams have a “functional” purpose, aiding with “memory, emotional processing and sensory processing.”</p>



<p>Now, this isn’t to say that all of your dreams will feel easy, or a nightly narrative of bliss and pleasure. That’s because our dreams help to guard against self-deception and in doing so, they often pack a metaphoric punch, encouraging you to ask: What is the message I’m not hearing? The “thing” that I’m not seeing? The path I’m afraid to follow? The feeling I’m unwilling to feel?</p>



<p>The snake I am unwilling to see?</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re simply seeing snakes everywhere once you go to sleep, there&#8217;s no need to worry. Here’s what to know if one slithers into your subconscious.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What do snakes in dreams mean?</h2>



<p>Snakes are both universal and personal symbols. From the ouroboros (a snake eating its own tail in a circle like shape) to the cosmic rainbow serpent, snake dreams can alert you to your state of consciousness and well-being, as well as the greater mysteries of life. &nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Snakes in dreams are a call to focus on healing, transformation and change</h3>



<p>Snakes are symbols of transformation and change. The Asclepius rod, a rod that has two snakes intertwining it, is a common sign for medical institutes because snakes have long been associated with healing.</p>



<p>So, if you dream of a snake in your house, you may need to focus on change, healing and transformation. Periods of change and adjustment often lead to life altering transformations although the process can feel emotionally intense.</p>



<p>Sometimes, you have to let go of what was, in order to let something new and better in. And a snake dream may just come to you in order to remind you of your innate ability to do just that.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Snakes in dreams also indicate it may be time to make a swift move</h3>



<p>Snakes shed their skin in one go. If you dream of a snake in this manner, it may symbolize that you need to shed a pattern, belief, or identity that is no longer serving you, in order to move through life more easily.</p>



<p>A dream like this also tells you that this can happen in one swoop movement — just like a snake sheds its skin easily so can you! Ask yourself—what do I need to release in order to transform into a healthier, happier version of me and can I allow these changes to happen with ease?</p>



<p>The dreamer will have to look at their own spiritual beliefs and ask themselves what the next right path is. It may be a calling to some type of initiation and learning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding different snake dream scenarios</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What does it mean if a snake chases, attacks or bites you in a dream?</strong></h3>



<p>II the snake in your dream was threatening or biting you then this type of dream may indicate that you need to pay attention to your relationships and partnerships.</p>



<p>As well as your own relationship to your instincts. Do you trust your gut? Are your instincts on sharp form? Have you let something poisonous into your life (unhealthy habits/beliefs/behaviors or people)? If so, the solution to something venomous is to remove the poisonous ‘thing’ from your life. No one needs toxicity in their life, and we all have to address our own negative behaviors too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What does it mean to dream of a specific snake species, like a constrictor or rattle snake?</h3>



<p>If a very specific type of snake shows up in your dream, you can take that as a sign to research that kind of particular snake. For example: a rattle snake asks you to see what is ‘rattling’ in your life? It is a dream message that is rattling you awake — it is saying that you need to pay attention and remain alert!</p>



<p>On the other hand, a boa constrictor could symbolize a situation in which you feel like something is squeezing the life out of you. And like all dreams, both in waking life and sleep, you are the key player. Focus on bringing your awareness to the here-and-now so that you can make conscious, helpful, and positive decisions that will serve you and those around you.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A highly contagious respiratory <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://tag/health-wellness" target="_blank">illness</a> is on the rise in the United States this year.</p>



<p>Cases of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/index.html" target="_blank">whooping cough, also known as pertussis</a>, have surged to pre-pandemic levels in 2024, according to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been over 17,500 cases of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/search-results-year/" target="_blank">nationally notifiable condition</a> reported this year as of Oct. 5, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/static/2024/40/2024-40-table990.html" target="_blank">according to CDC data</a>. The CDC says that figure is more than five times higher than the number of cases reported at the same time in 2023. It&#8217;s also substantially higher than the 10,879 cases <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/static/2019/40/2019-40-table1z.html" target="_blank">reported at the same time in 2019</a>, and the most since 2014.</p>



<p>So what exactly is whooping cough? And why are cases suddenly on the rise? Here&#8217;s what to know:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What is whooping cough?</h2>



<p>The CDC <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/index.html" target="_blank">defines whooping cough</a> as a very contagious respiratory illness caused by a bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. The bacteria attach to tiny, hair-like extensions called cilia that line part of the upper respiratory system and then release toxins, damaging the cilia and causing airways to swell.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How does whooping cough spread?</h2>



<p>Whooping cough can spread easily from person to person, according to the CDC. The bacteria that causes the illness gets released into the air through coughing and sneezing.</p>



<p>Those who contract whooping cough can spread the illness once symptoms start and up until at least two weeks after coughing begins, per the CDC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Why are whooping cough cases on the rise?</h2>



<p>The CDC says it&#8217;s likely that mitigation measures utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic, like masking and remote learning, led to a decrease in the transmission of&nbsp;whooping cough.</p>







<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Why is it called whooping cough?</h2>



<p>A common symptom of pertussis is a "whoop" noise that occurs when someone inhales following a coughing fit, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the CDC</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What are the signs and symptoms of whooping cough?</h2>



<p>It could be a while before those coughing fits begin, though. The CDC says early symptoms usually appear five to 10 days following exposure, but it could take as long as three weeks for them to develop. </p>



<p>Early symptoms are similar to a common cold, can last for one to two weeks and typically include a:</p>



<ul>
<li>Runny or stuffed-up nose</li>



<li>Low-grade fever (lower than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit)</li>



<li>Mild, occasional cough</li>
</ul>



<p>Coughing fits could begin one to two weeks after the initial symptoms show, the CDC says. The coughing fits typically last one to six weeks, but can remain for up to 10 weeks.</p>



<p>The coughing fits generally become worse and more frequent over time, and they can cause people to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Make a high-pitched "whoop" when they inhale after a coughing fit</li>



<li>Vomit during or after coughing fits</li>



<li>Feel very tired after the fit, but usually seem well in-between fits</li>



<li>Have difficulty sleeping at night</li>



<li>Struggle to breathe</li>



<li>Fracture a rib</li>
</ul>



<p>"Those who get these coughing fits say it's the worst cough of their lives," the CDC says.</p>



<p>It's important to note that many babies with whooping cough don't actually cough at all. The CDC says babies may instead experience life-threatening pauses in breathing called apnea, or pneumonia.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Does whooping cough go away on its own?</h2>



<p>The CDC says it's very important to treat whooping cough early and before the coughing fits begin. Early treatment could make the illness less serious and help prevent the spread of it.</p>



<p>In most cases, whooping cough can be managed at home by:</p>



<ul>
<li>Taking antibiotics exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider</li>



<li>Keeping your home free from things that cause coughing like smoke, dust and chemical fumes</li>



<li>Using a clean, cool mist humidifier to loosen mucus and soothe the cough</li>



<li>Eating small meals every few hours to help prevent vomiting</li>



<li>Getting plenty of fluids, including water, juices, and fruits</li>
</ul>



<p>The CDC instructs those with the illness not to take cough medicine unless recommended by a healthcare provider.</p>



<p>Hospital treatment may be required for those who develop serious symptoms or complications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Who's at higher risk for severe whooping cough cases?</h2>



<p>Babies younger than 1 year old are at the greatest risk of getting whooping cough and suffering from severe complications, per the CDC. That age group also experiences the highest rate of whooping cough. The CDC says <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/cases-of-whooping-cough-on-the-rise.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about one third</a> of babies younger than 1 who contract the illness need hospital treatment.</p>



<p>Those with pre-existing conditions that may be worsened by whooping cough, such as immunocompromising conditions, are also at high risk of developing a serious case of the illness, according to the CDC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Is there a whooping cough vaccine?</h2>



<p>Yes, and the CDC recommends it for people of all ages, as it's the best way to prevent the infection. The whooping cough vaccines work well but protection fades over time, according to the CDC. Those who get the illness and are vaccinated tend to develop milder cases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What is the whooping cough vaccine called?</h2>



<p>There are two types of combination vaccines that offer protection against whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus, according to the CDC. Children under the age of 7 receive the DTaP vaccine, while those 7 and older get the Tdap vaccine.</p>



<p>The CDC recommends pregnant women get the Tdap vaccine early in the third trimester of each pregnancy to protect babies from the illness in the first few months post-birth. The vaccination during pregnancy prevents nine in 10 babies from being hospitalized with whooping cough, per the CDC.</p>



<p>Adults getting the Tdap vaccine for the first time should get a booster dose at least once every 10 years, according to the CDC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What are the side effects of the whooping cough vaccine?</h2>



<p>The CDC says most people who get a whooping cough vaccine don't experience any serious side effects. The potential side effects tend to be mild and go away within a few days.</p>



<p>The mild side effects of the DTaP vaccine include swelling/soreness where the vaccine was given, fever, irritability, feeling tired, loss of appetite and vomiting, per the CDC. The Tdap vaccine, meanwhile, can lead to pain/redness/swelling where the vaccine was given, mild fever, headache, feeling tired and nausea/vomiting diarrhea/stomachache.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Seeds add a burst of flavor, texture and nutrition to any meal. And while all seeds are packed with some nutritional benefits, chia seeds and flaxseeds are some of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-seeds-rcna152397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthiest seeds</a>&nbsp;you could crunch on.</p>



<p>But if you can only add one of these seeds to your diet, which should you choose? Are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/health-benefits-chia-seeds-how-use-them-today-t231871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chia seeds</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/flaxseed-benefits-rcna130749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flaxseeds healthier</a>?</p>



<p>“The nutrition of these two seeds is very similar,&#8221; says Natalie Rizzo, registered dietitian and TODAY’s nutrition editor. &#8220;They are both a good source of protein, healthy fat and fiber,&#8221; she adds, which means they&#8217;ll help keep you full and aid in digestion and heart health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, depending on your individual health goals as well as your taste and recipe preferences, one type of seed may win out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fiber</h2>



<p>Dietitians have told TODAY.com&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-to-increase-fiber-intake-rcna123178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over and over</a>&nbsp;that fiber is a powerful nutrient. Not only does fiber aid in digestion and gut health, but it also helps support heart health and control of your blood sugar and cholesterol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, you&#8217;ll get a big boost of fiber from both chia seeds and flaxseeds. A full 2 tablespoon serving of flaxseeds provides 6 grams of fiber while the same amount of chia seeds packs almost double that amount: a whopping 10 grams of fiber.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Considering that people in the U.S. often fall short of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/high-fiber-snacks-rcna126257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber</a>&nbsp;per day, adding chia seeds or flaxseeds to your diet could significantly help you reach that goal.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Protein&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Protein is an essential macronutrient, which means we need a large amount of it every day to build and maintain muscle as well as our overall health. Because protein is also filling and satisfying, eating a high-protein diet&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/high-protein-low-calorie-foods-rcna145119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may aid in weight management</a>.</p>



<p>Generally, experts&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/high-protein-foods-rcna130229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommend getting 20 to 40 grams of protein</a>&nbsp;at each meal throughout the day. And while these tiny seeds aren&#8217;t going to get you to that amount on their own, they can help bump your meals up in protein when you need a bonus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to protein content, these two seeds are quite similar, but chia seeds have a slight advantage: A standard serving of flaxseeds (2 tablespoons) provides 4 grams of protein while the same serving size of chia seeds offers 6 grams of protein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eating chia seeds or flaxseeds with your meal will give you a little extra protein. Try using them to top a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-yogurt-rcna145315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-protein Greek yogurt</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/greek-yogurt-vs-cottage-cheese-rcna169340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cottage cheese</a>, or sprinkle a few on top of your morning protein shake or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/food/salad-recipes-t258914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lunchtime chicken salad</a>&nbsp;for a satisfying crunch.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fat</h2>



<p>When you’re looking at fat content, chia seeds and flaxseeds are just about even. A serving of each type of seeds will contain about 9 grams of fat, which is made up almost entirely of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthy-fat-food-rcna145846" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart-healthy unsaturated fats</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In particular, chia seeds and flaxseeds are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-seeds-rcna152397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both great sources of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids</a>&nbsp;which can have anti-inflammatory effects and help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/foods-that-prevent-heart-disease-women-rcna75320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protect against heart disease</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other nutrients</h2>



<p>In addition to the fiber, protein and healthy fats these seeds provide, each type of seed is also full of vitamin, minerals and health-promoting antioxidant compounds. But chia seeds and flaxseeds each have some unique selling points.</p>



<p>For those who follow a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/plant-based-diet-rcna136256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completely plant-based diet&nbsp;</a>and, therefore, don&#8217;t consume dairy, chia seeds can be an important source of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/food/foods-more-calcium-glass-milk-t110786" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calcium for bone health</a>, Rizzo says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, flaxseeds are heart-health superstars. In addition to the huge amount of plant-based omega-3s they contain, flaxseeds are also rich in lignans, an anti-inflammatory compound that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/flaxseed-benefits-rcna130749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">researchers think</a>&nbsp;also contributes to the seeds&#8217; beneficial effects on cholesterol and blood pressure.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are chia seeds or flaxseeds healthier?</h2>



<p>Chia seeds and flaxseeds are both very healthy foods that contain beneficial nutrients like fiber, protein and omega-3 fatty acids. That means both types of seeds can be great for gut health, heart health and contribute to feelings of satiety. However, chia seeds do contain slightly more fiber and protein than flaxseeds.</p>



<p>So, if you can only eat one or the other, which should you choose?</p>



<p>“I think there’s two reasons to pick one over the other,” Rizzo says. First, if you are following a fully plant-based diet and don&#8217;t eat dairy, chia seeds are a good source of calcium, she says, so you may want to opt for those.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When choosing between these seeds, it&#8217;s also important to also &#8220;consider the culinary use case,&#8221; Rizzo says. They both provide a ton of healthy nutrients, but 2 tablespoons is a large amount of either type of seed. So it can be hard to logistically work that many into your meals to get the full benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think about the kinds of foods you like to eat already and how flaxseeds or chia seeds might complement your meals.</p>



<p>For instance, flaxseeds have a slightly nutty taste and make a great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-granola-rcna148823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">granola ingredien</a>t or topping to yogurt, oatmeal or cottage cheese. They&#8217;re also often sold as ground powder or flaxseed meal, which can be mixed into baked goods, smoothies and protein shakes. In this form, you can also use them to &#8220;thicken veggie burgers and the like,&#8221; Rizzo says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to chia seeds, you can make an endlessly customizable chia seed pudding. Chia seeds expand in liquid, which gives them a unique gel-like texture and makes them even more filling. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/recipes/vanilla-almond-chia-seed-pudding-t66911" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make-ahead dish</a>&nbsp;acts as a great high-fiber breakfast or snack topped with fresh fruit. And, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-to-increase-fiber-intake-rcna123178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experts told TODAY.com previously</a>, this is the easiest way to get the full serving of chia seeds and all their nutritional benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not a fan of full-on chia seed pudding, you can still take advantage of their swelling powers by using them to thicken overnight oats or oatmeal, Rizzo suggests. (This swelling mechanism is also why you should not eat chia seeds on their own by the spoonful: The seeds can expand when they come in contact with your saliva and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/health-benefits-chia-seeds-how-use-them-today-t231871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potentially block your esophagus</a>.)</p>



<p>&#8220;Ultimately, both seeds are really good for you,&#8221; Rizzo says, &#8220;so use whichever one you like the most!”</p>

<p>When a woman has a mammogram, the most important finding is whether there’s any sign of breast cancer.</p>



<p>The second most important finding is whether her breasts are dense.</p>



<p>Since early September, a new U.S. rule requires mammography centers to inform women about their breast density — information that isn’t entirely new for some women because many states already had similar requirements.</p>



<p>Here’s what to know about why breast density is important.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are dense breasts bad?</h2>



<p>No, dense breasts are not bad. In fact, they’re quite normal. About 40% of women ages 40 and older have dense breasts.</p>



<p>Women of all shapes and sizes can have dense breasts. It has nothing to do with breast firmness. And it only matters in the world of breast cancer screening, said Dr. Ethan Cohen of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.</p>



<p>With the new rule, “there are going to be a lot of questions to a lot of doctors and there’s going to be a lot of Googling, which is OK. But we want to make sure that people don’t panic,” Cohen said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How is breast density determined?</h2>



<p>Doctors who review mammograms have a system for classifying breast density. </p>



<p>There are four categories. The least dense category means the breasts are almost all fatty tissue. The most dense category means the breasts are mostly glandular and fibrous tissue.</p>



<p>Breasts are considered dense in two of the four categories: “heterogeneously dense” or “extremely dense.” The other two categories are considered not dense.</p>



<p>Dr. Brian Dontchos of the Seattle-based Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center said the classification can vary depending on the doctor reading the mammogram &#8220;because it’s somewhat subjective.” </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why am I being told I have dense breasts?</h2>



<p>Two reasons: For one, dense breasts make it more difficult to see cancer on an X-ray image, which is what a mammogram is.</p>



<p>“The dense tissue looks white on a mammogram and cancer also looks white on a mammogram,” said Dr. Wendie Berg of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and chief scientific adviser to DenseBreast-info.org. “It’s like trying to see a snowball in a blizzard.”</p>



<p>Second, women with dense breast tissue are at a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer because cancers are more likely to arise in glandular and fibrous tissue. </p>



<p>Reassuringly, women with dense breasts are no more likely to die from breast cancer compared to other women.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What am I supposed to do?</h2>



<p>If you find out you have dense breasts, talk to your doctor about your family history of breast cancer and whether you should have additional screening with ultrasound or MRI, said Dr. Georgia Spear of Endeavor Health/NorthShore University Health System in the Chicago area.</p>



<p>Researchers are studying better ways to detect cancer in women with dense breasts. So far, there’s not enough evidence for a broad recommendation for additional screening. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force called for more research in this area when it updated its breast cancer screening recommendations earlier this year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do I still need a mammogram?</h2>



<p>Yes, women with dense breasts should get regular mammograms, which is still the gold standard for finding cancer early. Age 40 is when mammograms should start for women, transgender men and nonbinary people at average risk.</p>



<p>“We don’t want to replace the mammogram,” Spear said. “We want to add to it by adding a specific other test.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will insurance cover additional screening?</h2>



<p>For now, that depends on your insurance, although a bill has been introduced in Congress to require insurers to cover additional screening for women with dense breasts.</p>



<p>Additional screening can be expensive — from $250 to $1,000 out of pocket, so that’s a barrier for many women.</p>



<p>“Every woman should have equal opportunity to have their cancer found early when it’s easily treated,” Berg said. “That’s the bottom line.”</p>

<p>Chicken products served to students at nearly 200 Philadelphia schools may have been contaminated with listeria, the district announced on Friday.</p>



<p><strong><em><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/pollo-escuelas-filadelfia-posiblemente-contaminado-distrito-escolar/2435280/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/pollo-escuelas-filadelfia-posiblemente-contaminado-distrito-escolar/2435280/">Léelo&nbsp;en español aquí</a></em></strong></p>



<p>Oz Hill, the Chief Operating Officer of the Philadelphia School District, said they were notified by the Whitsons Culinary Group that the following chicken products that were provided to some schools in the district were part of a nationwide meat and poultry recall due to potentially being contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pre-K: Chicken &amp; Broccoli Alfredo Penne (served on Oct. 8)</li>



<li>Pre-K children with a food allergy substitution: Chicken Strips Honey Mustard Green Bean (served between Oct. 4 – Oct. 10) and Chicken Caribbean Pineapple Sauce Rice Carrots (served between Oct. 4 – Oct. 10)</li>



<li>K-12 sites: Chicken w/BBQ Sauce Rice Baked Beans (served on September 23, 2024)</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14KxpBKtf5u2wp8oPuoHsdtIMHhfa7wzyqlvKVbITWjw/edit?gid=0#gid=0">The full list of impacted schools can be found here.</a></p>



<p>Listeria are bacteria that can contaminate many foods. People most at risk for listeria infection include pregnant women, newborns, adults 65 years or older and people with weakened immune systems, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/about/index.html">according to the CDC.</a></p>



<p>“Fortunately, according to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Division (FSIS), there are no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of those meals,” Hill wrote.</p>



<p>Hill said the School District’s Division of Food Services is removing all remaining items from their school meal services.</p>



<p>“Your child will not be served this item moving forward,” Hill wrote.</p>



<p>Anyone with questions on the recall should email <a href="mailto:recallnotification101024@philasd.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recallnotification101024@philasd.org</a>&nbsp;or call&nbsp;<a href="tel:2154005600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">215-400-5600</a>.</p>

<p>Walking is a wonderful way to stay active and comes with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/physical-mental-benefits-walking-t207904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all kinds of health benefits</a>, including less back pain and improved fitness and mental health.</p>



<p>But what if the weather is unbearably hot or cold? Or what if you don&#8217;t have easy access to a walkable area? Is walking indoors just as good for you?</p>



<p>While there are many unique health boosts that come from being outside, indoor walking or walking on a treadmill, can still be great exercise, says Stephanie Mansour, certified personal trainer and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/start-today" target="_blank">Start TODAY</a>&nbsp;contributor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Benefits of walking outside</h2>



<p>Walking or running outside tends to be more challenging than inside, which may be a pro or con depending on your goals and your fitness level.</p>



<p>When you&#8217;re walking outside, &#8220;there&#8217;s more variation in your speed and your pace,&#8221; Dr. Jeanne Doperak, a primary care sports medicine physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, told TODAY.com previously.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll also be more likely to encounter different inclines and types of terrain, Mansour adds, like uneven pavement or a rocky, dirt road. &#8220;Physically, the different surfaces challenge your balance more than they would if you were on a treadmill or walking in place inside,&#8221; Mansour explains.</p>



<p>That means your workout will engage your leg muscles in a more &#8220;randomized&#8221; way, Mansour says. &#8220;When you walk uphill, you&#8217;re using more of your glutes and hamstrings as opposed to walking downhill, when you&#8217;re using more of your quads,&#8221; she explains.</p>



<p>While you can replicate some of that by adjusting the incline on a treadmill, it&#8217;s not the same as being challenged by what nature throws at you.</p>



<p>Simply being outdoors also comes with a ton of other sensory and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/eco-therapy-your-mentl-health-17-ways-get-dose-nature-t242429" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mental health benefits</a>, especially if you tend to stare at a screen while working out inside.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are a lot of physical benefits to being in nature, and (that&#8217;s) been shown in many studies,&#8221; Dr. Stacy Beller Stryer said on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/video/why-you-should-skip-the-treadmill-and-take-a-stroll-in-the-park-137855045716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the TODAY show previously</a>. These include reduced hypertension and risk of stroke, lower heart rate and risk of heart disease, improvement in diabetes symptoms and an increase in cancer-fighting cells in the immune system.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important for people of all ages to spend time outside regularly,&#8221; she said. Other research has shown benefits of being outside for our mental health, too, Stryer said, including reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as lower stress levels as measured by cortisol in the body.</p>



<p>“It’s always still good to go outside,” N’Namdi Nelson, an exercise physiologist at NYU Langone’s Sports Performance Center, told TODAY.com previously. “You want to look at different buildings, trees, birds, everything,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;That’s going to be healthier for you than just looking at a screen all day.”</p>



<p>Mansour calls it the &#8220;meditative aspect&#8221; of being outside. She regularly encourages people to focus on the smell of flowers or a freshly mowed lawn, as well as the feel of the heat from the sun or a cool breeze on their skin.</p>



<p>&#8220;It helps you to be a little bit more present and in-tune with your body, as opposed to being on a treadmill or being indoors,&#8221; she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Benefits of walking on a treadmill</h2>



<p>Walking or running outside gives you natural variation in pace, incline and terrain, but using a treadmill takes that variability and unpredictability out of the equation. For some folks, that&#8217;s a major benefit of an indoor workout.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re someone who struggles with balance or is prone to spraining your ankle,&#8221; Mansour recommends&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/31-day-indoor-walking-workout-cold-winter-days-rcna72180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting with indoor walking workouts</a>, ideally on a carpeted surface. That will be lower-impact than walking on pavement outside or on a treadmill, she says. And if you prefer to walk on a treadmill, take advantage of the handrails, Mansour says, which will help keep you steady while you walk.</p>



<p>The other advantage, of course, is that your treadmill is still available rain or shine, which means getting your walk or run in during the day is convenient no matter what the weather is like.</p>



<p>Walking pads, which are small enough to fit under a standing desk, are a popular option to get steps in during the day. However, note that many&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/walking-pad-review-rcna134124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walking pads</a>&nbsp;don’t come with handrails. “If you’re someone that has any problems with balance or any problems multitasking, don’t even look into a walking pad,” Mansour says. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Should you walk outside or on a treadmill?</h2>



<p>If you can, the experts recommend trying to do your walking or running outdoors for the most well-rounded and mental health-boosting workout. But if you can&#8217;t be outside for whatever reason, that&#8217;s OK. Know that you&#8217;re still getting major health benefits from your physical activity — indoors or outdoors, Mansour says.</p>



<p>She recommends people think about going for their walk like they&#8217;re choosing an adventure for the day: If you enjoy going on your walk every day outside no matter what the weather is like, then stick with that routine, she says. If it helps, think of your sweaty summer walk &#8220;like a detox,&#8221; Mansour says. &#8220;Or if you&#8217;re walking in the winter and you&#8217;re bundled up, look at it as free&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-cryotherapy-does-it-work-experts-discuss-t145522" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryotherapy</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>But if you&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s less motivated to get your walk in or someone for whom the weather is a major barrier, keep your treadmill in your back pocket as a perfectly fine alternative.</p>



<p>The most important thing is to get moving —&nbsp;and keep moving, Doperak said. &#8220;All in all, any exercise is good exercise,&#8221; she added. &#8220;And the health benefits of exercise are just endless.&#8221;</p>
