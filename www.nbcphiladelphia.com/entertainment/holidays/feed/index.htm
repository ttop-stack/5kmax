<p>‘Tis the season to give back—and receive a little extra help.</p>



<p>With Thanksgiving and Christmas coming up it’s the perfect time to know about what local organizations in our area are doing to help those in need.</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking for a place to give, you and your family are in need, or you know someone who is, here are some organizations making a difference this holiday season.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Big Toy Giveaways at the Jersey Shore</h2>



<p>Salvation Army in Atlantic City and Asbury Park have tons of toys for families in need for Christmas.</p>



<p>The non-profit has kicked off a two-day toy distribution to help brighten the holiday for more than 500 deserving kids.</p>



<p>“Last year they served 200 families, and so we&#8217;re up to 250 families this year. So, the need has grown,&#8221; Lt. Lesley Colon, with the Salvation Army Atlantic City, said.</p>



<p>Salvation Army Asbury Park is gearing up for its annual drive-thru distribution on Thursday, December 19.</p>

<p>The holiday season is in full swing and there&#8217;s no better way to get into the spirit than with a good ole Yule Log.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s one-up it though and make it Philly sports (because naturally, that makes everything better).</p>



<p>If you need something to pop on when hosting a party, hanging decorations, wrapping presents … or simply because you <em>desperately</em> miss baseball, head over to the Phillies YouTube channel for a Philly Mascots Yule Log.</p>







<p>Located in the heart of the Phillies clubhouse is a cozy set surrounded by colored lights (the best ones), two trees (adorned with Santa Phanatics), rocking chairs, a fireplace and a whole lot more.</p>



<p>Throughout the video, the Phillie Phanatic is visited by a ton of familiar faces including Gritty, Franklin, Phang and Swoop. Phoebe Phanatic also appears in an attempt to control the chaos of the crew — but gets into some of her own instead.</p>



<p>Larry Anderson makes a hysterical cameo, and if you listen closely, you&#8217;ll be able to hear NBC Sports Philadelphia&#8217;s very own Tom McCarthy with a voice-over.</p>



<p>Now, the Phanatic isn&#8217;t new to the Yule Log scene. He&#8217;s been bringing joy to the Phillies&#8217; YouTube channel for half a decade.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re really feeling festive, you can toss every version into a playlist to enjoy all day (and season) long.</p>















<p>A Philly Mascots Yule Log will also air on NBC Sports Philadelphia on December 25, Christmas Day, at 2:00 p.m.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>As the holiday season rolls around, one of the most debated parenting topics resurfaces: Should parents tell their kids that Santa isn’t real? Dr. Eileen Kennedy-Moore, a clinical psychologist and creator of the &#8220;<a href="https://drfriendtastic.com/podcasts/kids-ask-dr-friendtastic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kids Ask Dr. Friendtastic</a>&#8221; podcast, sheds light on this hot topic in an interview with NBC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When kids discover the truth</h2>



<p>&#8220;The average age that kids discover that Santa isn&#8217;t real is around age 8,” Dr. Kennedy-Moore explains. While the revelation may bring some mild disappointment, it’s often balanced by a sense of pride as kids feel they’ve joined the “in-the-know” crowd. Contrary to popular concern, research shows that discovering the truth about Santa doesn’t significantly damage children emotionally — or their trust in their parents.</p>



<p>In fact, many kids harbor doubts long before the truth is confirmed, sneaking around or piecing together clues like Mom and Dad using the same wrapping paper as Santa. Dr. Kennedy-Moore recounts a lovely response from her own mother: “Santa isn’t real, but the spirit of Christmas and the spirit of generosity is very real.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Addressing tough questions</h2>



<p>What should parents do when younger children start asking questions about Santa? Dr. Kennedy-Moore suggests turning the question back to them: “Well, what do you think? And follow the child&#8217;s lead.” This approach helps them answer their own questions.</p>



<p>For children under 8, it’s okay to let them hold onto the magic a little longer. “There’s no harm in this,” she says. However, for older kids who are still fervent believers, parents might want to step in, as delayed discoveries tend to cause stronger feelings of sadness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">The Santa talk in a diverse world</h2>



<p>Not all families engage in the Santa tradition for cultural or personal reasons, which can lead to tricky situations in schools or social settings. Dr. Kennedy-Moore advises parents to teach their kids to respect others’ beliefs. For many families and children, Santa is very important, “so don’t step on their parade,” she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">The ripple effect: Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny &amp; beyond</h2>



<p>Santa often serves as the linchpin for belief in other childhood figures like the Tooth Fairy or Easter Bunny. Once Santa is debunked, a domino effect tends to follow — but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ultimately, we want for our children to be able to be critical thinkers who say, &#8216;that doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense,&#8217;” says Dr. Kennedy-Moore. &#8220;I think that this is normal development.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Keeping the spirit alive</h2>



<p>While the magic of Santa may fade, the values of generosity and kindness endure. Dr. Kennedy-Moore encourages parents to focus on these lasting lessons, reminding children — and themselves — that the true spirit of Christmas transcends any one story.</p>



<p>So, whether you decide to keep the Santa myth alive or embrace honesty from the start, the research is clear: Kids are resilient, and the holidays remain a time for joy, connection and giving.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The holidays always bring a bevy of beverages for seasonal sipping. In recent years, we’ve tried the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/recipes/gingerbread-martini-recipe-t274798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gingerbread Martini</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/recipes/rudolph-cocktail-recipe-t120299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rudolph</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/food/drinks/snow-globe-cocktail-rcna128790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snowglobe</a>. This year, apparently, we’re making hot Dr Pepper.</p>



<p>Yes, it’s the same old soda standby you know and love, but with a literal twist! To make this trending tipple, you just heat Dr Pepper, add a slice of lemon and serve. You can warm it up in a mug once the carbonation dies down, or just Crock-Pot a whole 2-liter for a crowd.</p>







<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://drpeppermuseum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr Pepper Museum</a>&nbsp;serves it every winter, but it’s not the only one: Hudson Valley’s massive&nbsp; and legendary antiques store&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJKotvXHd_1/?igsh=MTFvcGxrN3AyaHZ5NA==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Newbergh Vintage Emporium</a>&nbsp;is using it to add that nostalgic holiday touch, because as popular as it is at the moment, it’s actually nothing new.</p>



<p>Dr Pepper first promoted the recipe in the 1960s to bump lagging sales in winter, as in this classic Dick Clark TV spot:</p>







<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJKotvXHd_1/?igsh=MTFvcGxrN3AyaHZ5NA==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some versions</a>&nbsp;even suggested spiking it with rum and calling it a “Boomer.”</p>



<p>Although not many people have remembered it until now, it was something of a staple at gameday concession stands and teens’ parties in the ‘60s and ‘70s (sans rum), at least in some parts of the country.</p>



<p>If you dig around in newspaper archives, you’ll see most mentions center in Texas, and that’s no coincidence: Dr Pepper was invented in Waco in 1885, making it the oldest soda in the United States.</p>



<p>According to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://drpeppermuseum.com/history/" target="_blank">brand lore</a>, a young pharmacist at Morrison’s Old Corner Drug Store was aiming to make a beverage that tasted the way the air around the flavored syrups counter smelled — and Dr Pepper was born.</p>







<p>That spicy-fruity background of indistinguishably commingled aromas is allegedly what makes Dr Pepper work as a hot drink. The recipe is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drpepper.ca/en/blend-of-23-flavours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hilariously closely-guarded secret</a>, of course, but the company is willing to disclose that there are 23 flavors that go into the final product, and it is rumored to include things like cherry, apricot, almond, licorice and anise. The only thing I can say for sure? It doesn’t have prunes in it. That persistent rumor has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/belle-pepper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thoroughly debunked</a>.</p>



<p>Now that I feel reassured that there’s no prune juice in it, I’m ready for a taste test! Since I am a late-20th-century native Texan, I actually had this a few times growing up and remember it fondly. Still, sometimes the fog of yesteryear clouds the truth and I feel a rising dread. Is this beverage up-and-coming or a has-been?</p>



<p>I prefer sodas made with cane sugar and I’m betting, for this drink, that’s doubly important. Real sugar has a more complex flavor and crisper finish than corn syrup and heating can bring out the less desirable mouthfeel and flavor of the latter.</p>



<p>I poured it into a microwave-safe mug, stirred to banish most of the bubbles and heated for 1 minute. It smells uncannily familiar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-20-at-12.25.40%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hot Dr Pepper may look like black coffee but it smells like hot Dr Pepper. (Courtesy Heather Martin)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Warming happily brings the purported spice flavors to the forefront but I found the first sip too sweet. (Carbonation isn’t just bubbles; it reacts to form carbonic acid and adds a tartness that you’ll find lacking when it goes flat.) I rubbed the peel on the mug lip and added a giant squeeze of lemon with a tiny smidge of sea salt, maybe 10 fine grains, to smooth out the sweetness. With those tweaks, it’s solidly in drinkable territory, at least for old times’ sake.</p>



<p>If you’re a devotee of the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/food/trends/coffee-mate-dr-pepper-dirty-soda-creamer-rcna142245" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dirty soda fad</a>, you may be tempted to add a little drizzle of half-and-half, but I wouldn’t risk it. With that extra lemony acidity, the resulting curds and whey will have you wondering if there’s a doctor in the house.</p>



<p>On that suspect dairy note, it turns out Dr Pepper is having a banner year with a second trending holiday drink, Dr Pepper and eggnog, or “Pepp Nog,” if you will.</p>







<p>There’s no set recipe on social media, but there is at least one in published form, in the “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/zzbf3m/dr_pepper_egg_nog_1980/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Garvin County Extension Homemakers Recipe Book 1980</a>.” That one has a lot more eggnog than Dr Pepper, but the ones trending online have the opposite ratio. Let’s try both!</p>



<p>I agree with most of the taste testers on social media about the mostly Dr Pepper version;&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/overthetoppopshop/reel/DDazp7eSw8i/" target="_blank">it’s not good</a>. It didn’t curdle at least, but it’s something like&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.yoo-hoo.com/" target="_blank">Yoo-hoo</a>&nbsp;gone very wrong, simultaneously too watery and too sweet. There’s a strange, sour aftertaste, perhaps the nutmeg clashing with the cola flavor. It also makes a scummy-looking foam until it calms down a bit. Bah humbug!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-20-at-12.25.25%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A glass of 20% Dr Pepper and 80% eggnog. (Courtesy Heather Martin)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The other way around, roughly 80% eggnog and 20% Dr Pepper, is a lot better. Don’t get me wrong — it’s still weird — but it doesn’t foam so alarmingly, and the flavors are more harmonious. I actually added extra nutmeg. I think it’s best very cold, and after I let it sit with a few ice cubes and dilute slightly, it wasn’t so (cringe) viscous.</p>



<p>Of the three, I think the last is best. It has classic holiday flavors, some retro appeal&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;a little modern pizazz.</p>



<p>If you don’t do milk? Dr Pepper has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drpepperrecipes.com/non-alcoholic-beverages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recipes for beverages</a>&nbsp;online including oat milk as an ingredient, so if you don’t want to find out the hard way which plant milks curdle, maybe opt for one of the oat nogs on the market.</p>



<p>If you don’t do eggnog? In that case, I’m not sure I can help you. Maybe you should shake up a big green glass of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/recipes/grinch-cocktail-recipe-t120298" target="_blank">Grinch</a>!</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s a family story they can chuckle about NOW. But Lisa Highfill wasn&#8217;t laughing that December day almost 20 years ago.</p>



<p>She had just parked the car in the garage when her then-8-year-old son let loose with something he had found out while at school.</p>



<p>“My son looks at me, he goes, ‘There’s no Santa. You’ve been lying to me,'&#8221; recalls Highfill, 56, of Pleasanton, California. “He caught me red-handed, I didn’t know what to say.”</p>



<p>She&#8217;s not alone in that. Welcome to the holiday season. It&#8217;s that time of year filled with <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/christmas">Christmas</a> cheer, presents, and the ever-present parental question: <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/holidays/parenting-truth-about-santa-dr-friendtastic-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do we tell the kids the truth about Santa Claus</a>? (And if you don&#8217;t know what that truth is, you shouldn&#8217;t be reading this story! Stop it! Stop it right now!)</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no getting away from Santa Claus, the jolly, bearded old man who&#8217;s been celebrated for the better part of two centuries for bringing presents in a one-night, world-wide giving spree. He&#8217;s been the subject of poems and stories, movies and songs, invoked as the judge of naughty or nice, the recipient of countless cookies and glasses of milk to sustain him on his journey.</p>



<p>Not bad for someone who doesn&#8217;t actually, you know, exist.</p>



<p>(Too late for a spoiler alert?)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Many parents want to give their kids magic</h2>



<p>For a lot of parents and other adults, perpetuating that Santa Claus is real is a chance to give young children a bit of holiday magic, a brief, precious time before the realities of life sweep the illusions away. Others, though, are more skeptical, raising concerns about some of the messaging in Santa&#8217;s story, such as the constant surveillance over behavior, and in an era where we&#8217;re all worried about disinformation, misinformation and parents lying to children.</p>



<p>For David Kyle Johnson, a professor of philosophy at King&#8217;s College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the concern is the lengths some parents go to in order to eke out the last bits of belief from their kids, such as denying their dawning suspicions as they get older over how Santa Claus could logically do what he&#8217;s supposed to.</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s Santa, it’s fun or whatever. But you’re teaching them lessons about how to think and how to evaluate evidence, right?,” Johnson says. “And how many people grow up then as adults who believe things just because they want to believe things, because it feels good — believe things because it confirms the world view that makes them feel good, right?”</p>



<p>For Tara Boyce, it&#8217;s about being consistent about being factual and truthful with her two sons, 6 and 7, that she&#8217;s always been Santa, and that Christmas doesn&#8217;t need him to be magical. At the same time, she&#8217;s told them that people in other homes do things differently, so it&#8217;s not on her boys to try to disillusion their friends.</p>



<p>Her sons “love Christmas. They love the lights. They love the movies. They love the music. They love the cartoons. They love all the trappings,&#8221; says Boyce, 46, of Livermore, California.</p>



<p>“They can’t miss what they never had, which is like the mystery of Santa, but they appreciate all the other things.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">The modern ‘Santa’ recipe has many ingredients</h2>



<p>An American creation amalgamated from a variety of European cultures and immigrant communities, Santa Claus emerged in the 19th century and was firmly entrenched in American culture by the early part of the 20th century.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s unique among made-up characters like the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny because a whole story, a world, has been developed around him over the decades, says Thomas Ruys Smith, professor of American literature and culture at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>“Where does he live? Is he married? Who makes his toys? We could all give you answers to those questions based on pieces of popular culture,&#8221; he says. “We feel we know Santa Claus.”</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no empirical evidence whatsoever that shows any kind of definitive harm or good coming to children over a belief in Santa Claus. Candice Mills, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Dallas who has done a research study into how children felt about learning Santa isn&#8217;t real, found that for most kids in the study, negative feelings over discovering the truth were usually short-lived.</p>



<p>“They look forward to new traditions. They get to celebrate with their siblings. They get to still enjoy getting presents from Santa Claus, even though they know it’s not real,” she says.</p>



<p>And when talking to parents, Mills&#8217; research found that many of those planned to or were incorporating a Santa tradition for their kids even as they recalled being upset at learning the truth as children themselves.</p>



<p>It was tradition that had Highfill and her husband bringing Santa Claus into their Christmas celebrations with their sons to begin with, echoing as parents what their parents had done for them.</p>



<p>She hadn&#8217;t thought about how it would conflict with the parenting lessons they were trying to impart to the boys, that telling the truth was paramount. Those were lessons the boys had taken to heart, as the upset in the car made clear, she recalls with a laugh.</p>



<p>“I go inside, he won’t come out of the car. &#8230; He’s in there screaming and crying. He’s very upset. I’ve deceived him. His life is a lie. `How could you have done this?&#8217;”</p>



<p>It was a big moment, but it didn&#8217;t destroy her son&#8217;s enjoyment of the holiday in the years afterward. If anything, Highfill says, it became a special thing he shared with his parents, especially when it came to keeping his younger brother from finding out.</p>



<p>“He wanted to keep it from his brother, which was kind of funny,” Highfill says. “He’s like &#8230; we don’t want to spoil it for him because he’s really into it. He’s a 6-year-old.”</p>

<p>This holiday season, the very last of one local family&#8217;s Christmas trees are being shaken, bundled and getting their fresh cuts. </p>

<p>Jeannie Wood and her father made their very first sale back in 1970 when Bob and Bonnie Poynter started the farm in Felton, Delaware, to help pay for their three daughters&#8217; college dreams. </p>



<p>The farm became a tradition for many in Kent County and a way for the family to come back together every holiday season. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ve all been doing it for a long time so I think we are all ready to retire,&#8221; Wood told NBC10. My dad and I planted the first trees in 1967.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Bob Poynter died a few years ago followed by his wife Bonnie last summer, the family agreed that this year would be the last for the tree farm. </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be different but I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s gonna be like because we&#8217;ve never experienced it. We&#8217;ve always been doing this,&#8221; Wood said. </p>







<p>From the Christmas shop to the wreath workshop, it&#8217;s a bittersweet moment for the family and for their loyal customers. </p>



<p>Many of the customers come from a couple of hours away just to buy their tree at Poynter&#8217;s every year. </p>



<p>All of the trees that are ready for sale have been sold already. Before the family sells the land, they will have to decide what to do with all of the little trees that are still too small to be sold this year. </p>



<p>If you want to check out Poynter&#8217;s before they close, you have until Christmas Eve to shop for ornaments and nutcrackers. </p>

<p>&#8216;Tis the season for Christmas trees! But when you’re putting up the tree and decorating it with beautiful lights, there are important safety tips to remember.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Clean your fireplace &nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you have a fireplace in your home, make sure you’ve cleared it all out before lighting it. Also make sure the chimney is cleaned as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Keep your tree away from heat sources</h2>



<p>One out of four tree fires are the result of a tree being too close to a heat source. Not only does that include your fireplace, but it also includes space heaters. So make sure you keep your tree at least three feet away from your fireplace, space heater or any other heat source.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Water your tree each day</h2>



<p>If you do have a live tree, make sure you continually water it daily as dry pine needles could become a safety hazard.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Smoke alarms and fire extinguisher</h2>



<p>Remember to always have a smoke alarm with fresh batteries and a fire extinguisher nearby in the event of a fire emergency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Be careful hanging your Christmas lights</h2>



<p>One out of three tree fires are the result of an electrical failure. As you’re hanging Christmas lights around your tree, remember to limit those strands to three or less.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>A former kindergarten teacher is sounding off on what she calls the “fruitcake” of classroom gifts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“First of all, teachers always appreciate gifts, whether it’s art from a student or a handwritten card,” Natalie Parmenter tells&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/parents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TODAY.com</a>. “It means a lot, because we work really hard and don’t always get recognition.”</p>



<p>But according to Parmenter, educators do not want another coffee mug … ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When I moved in with my husband, he asked me to do a purge of my mugs because they filled up two cabinets in our kitchen,” Parmenter says. “The last thing we need is one more comically oversized mug that can’t go in the dishwasher.”</p>







<p>Instead, Parmenter, founder of&nbsp;<a href="https://primaryfocus.tv/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Primary Focus</a>, a resource hub for parents, suggests giving a gift card to a locally owned coffee shop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To put inside our mugs!” Parmenter exclaims. “Teachers love getting gift cards — no matter the dollar amount. It’s the thought that counts.”</p>



<p>Chelsea Layne, a teacher who shares tips on social media, agrees with Parmenter.</p>



<p>“I grateful for each and every gift I’ve ever gotten,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chelsealaynejohnson/video/7039485484342578437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Layne wrote, in part on TikTok</a>. “But after eight years, I do have 30 coffee mugs from students and I’m running out of space, people!”</p>



<p>Arizona teacher Patricia Britton also issued a PSA on TikTok about coffee mugs.</p>



<p>“Do not give us this,”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@buzzyteachers/video/7442855883865885983" target="_blank">Britton says, while holding up a figural Christmas tree mug</a>. “We teachers do not want more mugs. I have a cabinet full of them, and I do not need more.”</p>







<p>If you&#8217;re scrambling for a last-minute teacher gift, kindergarten teacher&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@madisonstew/video/7446570507333586222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madison Stewart recently posted on TikTok</a>&nbsp;asking other educators for the best holiday gift they’ve ever received. Responses included:</p>



<ul>
<li>“A broken snowman ornament that a family said the child could take off the family tree for his teacher because they couldn’t afford anything. He choose the snowman because he knew I loved snow.”</li>



<li>“I had the sweetest child in third grade almost 20 years ago. She knew I liked the Steelers football team and painted a piece of wood black and yellow and made it into a ruler. I still have it.”</li>



<li>“Gift cards to places where I can’t use it on classroom supplies lol (where I’m forced to pick something for myself — like a dinner out or a new shirt).”</li>



<li>“I love getting blankets.”</li>



<li>“Box of homemade Christmas cookies.”</li>



<li>“I LOVE getting pictures, drawings and cards from my students and families. I have EVERY single one that I’ve received in my early childhood education years (10+years).”</li>



<li>“I actually LIKE mugs!”</li>
</ul>

<p>On Christmas Eve in 1741, Moravian settlers named this Pennsylvania city after the biblical birthplace of Jesus. Nearly 300 years later, Moravians continue celebrating their Christmas season traditions in Bethlehem.</p>



<p>They include the “putz,” a Nativity scene that tells the story of Christ’s birth with miniature wooden figurines, the making of thousands of beeswax candles by hand as a symbol of the light that Jesus brought to the world and a “lovefeast,” a song service where worshippers share a simple meal of sweet buns and coffee in their pews.</p>



<p>“Like all Moravian traditions, the importance of it is that it brings people together,” said the Rev. Janel Rice, senior pastor of Central Moravian Church — Bethlehem’s first congregation and the oldest Moravian church in North America.</p>



<p>“Building community, emphasizing that, over doctrine or dogma, is really the Moravian practice and tradition at our core,&#8221; she said.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">

</div>



<p>Moravians relate to the story of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Rice said, because their ancestors began as a refugee church fleeing religious persecution. The Nativity is also a poignant reminder today, when the number of people fleeing their homes because of war, violence and persecution continues to rise worldwide.</p>



<p>“It’s so crucial because this story is not just Jesus’s story of 2,000 years ago. It’s today’s story. And we need to make sure that we&#8217;re living the word that we were told when it comes to these refugees,” said church member Sarah Wascura. “That word is to give them refuge and to take care of them and to love them as ourselves.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>A Pennsylvania town founded on Christmas Eve</strong></h2>



<p>The Moravian Church is one of the world&#8217;s oldest Protestant denominations. Its name comes from the historical provinces of Bohemia and Moravia in what is now the Czech Republic.</p>



<p>Their beliefs of practice over dogma began with a religious reformer, John Hus, who led a protest movement against some of the practices of Roman Catholic hierarchy. Hus believed congregants in his church should listen to Mass and read the Bible in their native Czech instead of Latin. He was accused of heresy and burned at the stake in 1415.</p>



<p>His ideas were carried on by his supporters, who broke with Rome and founded the Moravian Church, or Unitas Fratrum (Unity of Brethren) in 1457 — decades before Martin Luther’s Protestant Reformation.</p>



<p>Moravians facing persecution eventually fled to Herrnhut, Germany, and established the original Renewed Moravian Church settlement, according to accounts of church history.</p>



<p>Moravian missionaries later settled in Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>On Christmas Eve in 1741, their leader, Count Nicolas Ludwig von Zinzendorf, who was visiting them, led them to a stable, where they sang the hymn “Jesus Call Thou Me.” Its lyrics say: “Not Jerusalem — lowly Bethlehem &#8217;twas that gave us Christ to save us.” Thus inspired, Zinzendorf named the settlement Bethlehem. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>A beloved tradition retells the story of the birth of Jesus</strong></h2>



<p>Bethlehem’s first settlers brought with them hand-carved figures to retell the story of Christ&#8217;s birth. The tradition is known as the putz, from the German word “putzen,” meaning to clean or decorate.</p>



<p>“It relates back to the creches of the Middle Ages,” Rice said. “But it’s not just a creche, which would be just the one Nativity scene.”</p>



<p>Instead, it uses figures to tell different parts of the Gospel in miniature, including Mary’s annunciation and the visit of the three wise men to the infant Jesus.</p>



<p>In Victorian days, Rice said, Bethlehem’s residents would “go putzing” — visiting each other’s homes between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Day to look at Nativity scenes.</p>



<p>In 1937, the local chamber of commerce launched a campaign promoting Bethlehem as “Christmas City USA.” As part of that promotion, they took the tradition of the putz to the historic Hotel Bethlehem on Main Street. Thousands turned up.</p>



<p>“The story goes that the hotel got so crowded that they couldn’t really accommodate the number of people that were coming to see it, and they asked Central Moravian Church to host it.”</p>



<p>For every Christmas since then, the community putz has been put together by the church’s congregants and displayed at the nearby Christian education building.</p>



<p>“It’s more than Christmas for four weeks a year,” said Wascura, who went to the putz on her first date with Bob Wascura, her husband of 33 years.</p>



<p>“The nature of the faith heritage of the city is something that is never forgotten.”</p>



<p>On a recent day, she led families visiting the community putz to their seats. After recounting a brief history of the Moravian Church and the Pennsylvania city, she drew a curtain to display the dozens of wooden figures — angels, shepherds, kings carrying gifts — in a tiny landscape decorated with pebbles, wood and moss.</p>



<p>Children and parents listened to the recorded voice of Janel Rice, who narrated the biblical story about the other Bethlehem.</p>



<p>“We might wonder why setting up a putz and telling the story of Jesus’ birth is so important to the Moravians, and now to the city of Bethlehem,” Rice says in the recording. “One reason has to do with the naming of the city itself.”</p>



<p>The church choir, after some singing, gave way to the powerful sound of the renowned Moravian Trombone Choir, known for playing its brassy tunes from the belfry of Central Moravian Church. When the lights turned on, children approached the stage to look up close at the figurines and point at surprises near the manger, including miniature zebras, lions and giraffes.</p>



<p>“We feel really lucky to live so close to Bethlehem with all of the history here and specifically the history pertaining to Christmas,&#8221; said visitor Kelly Ann Ryan. “It’s just something that we can’t miss every holiday season as it rolls around.”</p>



<p>She came to Bethlehem from a nearby town with her husband, Daniel, and their 5- and 8-year-old sons to see the community putz, in what she said has become a family tradition.</p>



<p>“Telling the Christmas story this way is a great way for kids to connect with it.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Lighting candles on Christmas Eve, joining Santa for a sleigh ride</strong></h2>



<p>Christmas — from the Christian celebration to the secular commercial holiday — is omnipresent in Bethlehem.</p>



<p>On a recent day, Santa Claus checked on a red sleigh (drawn by horses instead of reindeer) outside Central Moravian before he led families who hopped on for a tour of Bethlehem and its Moravian church settlements, which were recently designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.</p>



<p>Others strolled to nearby holiday-themed wooden huts or along Main Street with its stores decorated with Christmas globes and Moravian stars. Some stopped outside an Italian restaurant to greet Santa and Mrs. Claus, who welcomed diners and posed for photos.</p>



<p>Across town, vendors sold ornaments at Christkindlmarkt, in the shadow of rusting blast furnaces of Bethlehem Steel illuminated in red and green. That company once supplied steel for construction of the Empire State Building, the Golden Gate Bridge and other landmarks.</p>



<p>At Central Moravian, the choir sang hymns while sacristans handed out buns and mugs of coffee to families who enjoyed the sustenance in their pews at the “lovefeast.”</p>



<p>After Rice delivered a final blessing, Linda Thudium walked up the stairs and opened a large closet, where the congregation keeps thousands of handmade candles wrapped in red ribbons that they light during Christmas services.</p>



<p>“To me, this is Christmas — looking at these candles,” said Thudium. She recalled attending Christmas Eve services with lit candles since she was 5, a tradition she continued with her children and grandchildren.</p>



<p>“To me, this is just magical. I remember my parents doing this, my grandparents,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It’s just a wonderful warm feeling of being connected with this church.”</p>

<p>People in one Jersey Shore neighborhood are honoring the memory of a beloved teen during this holiday season. </p>



<p>At first, it might seem like there&#8217;s a lack of holiday originality in Toms River&#8217;s Twin Oaks neighborhood, but it&#8217;s no Christmas coincidence that the exact same Santa is towering over lawns there. </p>



<p>House after house has an identical 12-foot inflatable to honor the memory of 15-year-old Leigha Cirillo. </p>



<p>&#8220;She loved Christmas, and this is for her,&#8221; said Twin Oaks resident Marianne Campisi. </p>



<p>Leigha lost her battle with a rare chromosomal disorder in Sept. Her mother, Erica Cirillo, had ordered the first blow-up Santa last month and encouraged others to do the same. </p>



<p> “Everybody jumped on board. I mean, there was like no hesitation whatsoever,&#8221; said neighbor Antonio Piano.</p>

<p>“It just makes me so happy to see them all and everyone in support in honor of Leigha,&#8221; said Kristianna Cirillo, Leigha&#8217;s sister. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What is the story of Hanukkah and why does it last for eight days?</h2>



<p>Hanukkah, or Chanukah, celebrates the the Maccabean Revolt against the Syrian-Greek army. In the second century B.C., the Holy Land was ruled by the Syrian King Antiochus IV Epiphanes who told the Jewish people they must renounce their religion and accept Greek beliefs or be sentenced to death, according to <a href="https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/102978/jewish/The-Story-of-Chanukah.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chabad.org.</a> A small group of poorly armed Jewish rebels, led by Judah Maccabee, fought back and successfully drove the Syrian-Greeks from the land, reclaiming the Holy Temple in Jerusalem.</p>



<p>When the victorious rebels sought to light the Temple’s menorah, the seven-branched candelabrum, there was only enough oil to keep the candles burning for a single day. However, in what is considered a miracle in Jewish faith, the flames continued to flicker for eight nights.</p>



<p>While the menorah used in the ancient holy temple only had seven branches, the Hanukkah menorah has nine candlestick holders — one for each night of Hanukkah and the &#8220;<em>shamash</em>&#8221; (attendant) to light the others.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How is Hanukkah observed?</h2>



<p>The main Hanukkah tradition is the lighting of the commemorative menorah. On the first night, two candles are lit: the shamash and the first branch. Over the next seven days, an additional candle is lit until all eight lights are aflame. </p>



<p>Candles are added to the menorah from right to left, but lit each night starting with the left-most candle.</p>



<p>Traditional blessings and songs are recited during the lighting of each candle, which occurs after sunset (except on Fridays when it is lit before the Shabbat candles). Generally, the menorah is placed in a window or doorway for those outside the home to see it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What are other Hanukkah traditions?</h2>



<p>Hanukkah is perceived as a marquee Jewish holiday in the U.S. due to its proximity to Christmas. But in fact, Hanukkah is not as important as the High Holidays of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Passover.</p>



<p>Over the years, one tradition that has been adopted by Jews in the U.S. is the custom of gift-giving. Jewish parents often give out presents to their children on Hanukkah, usually one gift on each of the eight nights.</p>



<p>“It’s important to recognize that it is an American Jewish phenomenon, this gift-giving that’s part of Hanukkah,” Rabbi Menachem Creditor, scholar in residence at the UJA-Federation of New York, told <a href="https://time.com/5747552/hanukkah-gifts-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time</a> magazine. “It’s not historically part of Hanukkah at all.”</p>



<p>Playing the dreidel is also customary during this time. A dreidel is a four-sided spinning top with Hebrew letters written on it. Winning or losing the game depends on the letter which the dreidel lands on when it is spun. Gelt is a reward used by children when playing dreidel. Gelt is traditionally either real money or chocolate coins.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What kind of food is served on Hanukkah?</h2>



<p>Since the holiday is centered around the miracle of the oil, a traditional Hanukkah menu is composed of foods fried in oil. Families typically eat latkes (potato pancakes) garnished with applesauce or sour cream and sufganiyah (round jelly doughnuts). There is also plenty of dairy-based dishes, challah bread and brisket. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Boxing Day is a holiday celebrated yearly by the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries including Canada, New Zealand and Australia.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what to know about the celebration.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Why is it called Boxing Day?</h2>



<p>The exact origin of Boxing Day is unclear, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/093656965db202d894263735af845bfa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Associated Press</a>.</p>



<p>Some believe it comes from the alms boxes churches put out to collect donations for the less fortunate. Others, however, attribute it to the old practice of giving boxes of gifts to servants on the day after Christmas as they were required to work on Christmas Day.</p>



<p>It has nothing to do with the sport of boxing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What does Boxing Day celebrate?</h2>



<p>Traditionally, Boxing Day has been recognized as a day to give gifts to servants, tradespeople and the poor. </p>



<p>Today, the holiday is associated with shopping at &#8220;big box&#8221; stores that sell things like technology— similar to Black Friday in the United States — and sporting events like horse racing and rugby.</p>



<p>Since it is a public holiday, most people have the day off from work or school in the countries in which Boxing Day is celebrated. Most people use the day to shop, spend time with family, watch sporting events and eat leftovers from Christmas dinner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When is Boxing Day 2024?</h2>



<p>This year, Boxing Day falls on Thursday, Dec. 26.</p>



<p>The holiday always falls on the day after Christmas Day unless the 26th happens to be a Saturday or Sunday. In that case, the holiday is observed on the following Monday.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Do Americans celebrate Boxing Day?</h2>



<p>Boxing Day is not typically celebrated in the United States.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Is Boxing Day the same as St. Stephen&#8217;s Day?</h2>



<p>Boxing Day occurs on the same day as the Christian feast day of St. Stephen. </p>



<p>St. Stephen is the patron saint of bricklayers and stonemasons, and he was known for his care of the poor, according to the <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/learn-about-art/paintings-in-depth/painting-saints/saint-stephen#:~:text=Saint%20Stephen%20is%20the%20patron,them%20for%20murdering%20the%20Messiah." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Gallery of London</a>.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>After the busy Black Friday holiday weekend, Kristen Tarnol, owner of Emerald Forest Gifts in Studio City, California, is already asking her supplier to send more more fuzzy alpaca scarves and warm slippers that were best sellers over the weekend.</p>



<p>“Even though it’s Los Angeles … I think people are looking for cozy items, really,” she said.</p>



<p>With a late Thanksgiving, the holiday shopping season is five days shorter than last year, and owners of small retail shops say people have been quick to snap up holiday décor early, along with gifts for others and themselves. Cozy items like sweaters are popular so far. But there’s little sense of the freewheeling spending that occurred during the pandemic.</p>



<p>Overall, The National Retail Federation predicts retail sales in November and December will rise between 2.5% and 3.5% compared with same period a year ago. Online shopping is expected to grow too. Adobe Digital Insights, a division of software company Adobe, predicts an 8.4% increase online for the full season.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Comfort and &#8216;whimsy’</h2>



<p>Some owners say shopping has been erratic so far this holiday season. Nathan Waldon, who owns Nathan &amp; Co., with two gift shops in Oakland, California, said he had his best Black Friday ever, with sales up 32%. But business slowed dramatically after that. He’s hoping it picks up again soon.</p>



<p>“I still feel like I’m optimistic for the season,” he said. “But it’s definitely going to be one of those roller coaster seasons again.”</p>



<p>He said comforting items are selling: Scarves, hats and gloves, humorous Christmas and Hanukkah cards and bright colors.</p>



<p>“People want that sense of whimsy, that sense of fun,” he said. ”A couple of seasons ago everything was sort of muted and earthy, and now everyone is craving happy colors.”</p>



<p>One of his top sellers is a bright pink sweater with the word “Merry” written in big letters that sells for $120. But generally, shoppers are looking to spend less than half of that, he said.</p>



<p>“It could be they could buy the $25 item, but then they’ll add on a little something extra,” he said. “It seems to me that the sweet spot is between 40 and 50 bucks.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bouncing back</h2>



<p>Small businesses in some parts of the country are hoping holiday shopping helps them recover from extreme weather during the year. In Florida, Jennifer Johnson, owner of consignment shop True Fashionistas in Naples, Florida, had a slow summer season, partly because the area was hit by three hurricanes this year. She decided to increase her Black Friday weekend discount this year to draw in shoppers – offering a 25%-off deal rather than the 18% to 20% she normally offers.</p>



<p>It worked. The store had record sales days over the weekend. People snapped up festive Christmas outfits and Christmas décor. The Christmas décor, including ornaments, candles and other home decorations, is selling faster than last year, she said.</p>



<p>“Last year we were out of Christmas stuff like by the second week of December, and we’re almost out of it now and it’s only the first week of December,” Johnson said.</p>



<p>As for clothing: “anything sequins, anything that has had bedazzling on it, anything that looks fine and festive is what they were buying,” she said.</p>



<p>At her three Philadelphia-area Serendipity shops that sell clothing, accessories and home goods, owner Nicole Beltz also faced weather-related challenges in foot traffic over the year, including snow in the first quarter, a lot of rain in the second quarter and extreme heat in the third quarter. An unpredictable economy and tough competition on pricing from bigger chains were also obstacles during the year.</p>



<p>During the Black Friday weekend, she offered 20% off for orders of $75 or more and 30% off orders of $150 and more. Last year she just offered discounts on select items, not blanket discounts.</p>



<p>“We gave out our biggest incentive ever for shoppers to come out with discounts and promos. I certainly think that that was necessary this year,” she said.</p>



<p>Beltz’ customers gravitated toward prices either under $20 or around $100. At her shops, Philadelphia Eagles and Taylor Swift merchandise were the top sellers, including $14 socks and $99 sweaters.</p>



<p>“One is the impulse category, where if it’s under $20, they’ll buy it. No matter what,” she said. “And then the second category would be for really people that are coming in looking for a gift. We’re pushing the $100 sale. We try to keep our best sellers, like those sweaters and those items that people are really grabbing for a nice holiday gift at $99, right under the $100 mark.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;Extra touch&#8217;</h2>



<p>Not all small businesses can use discounts to drive business, since margins are often tight.</p>



<p>Between Friends Boutique in Philadelphia is using events to drive holiday traffic instead. They held a “Sweater Explosion” event at 8 a.m. on Black Friday where they served hot apple cider and hot chocolate with marshmallows and promoted different styles of sweaters.</p>



<p>Sweaters under $100 were big sellers, along with $25 reversible silk scarves that feature art from impressionists like Monet.</p>



<p>“Our customers appreciated that little extra touch of laughs during the holidays. Coming in and smelling the cinnamon in the air felt like the holidays have arrived,” co-owner Claudia Averette said. Sales are up so far from last year, she added.</p>



<p>They’re also hosting a “Bourbon and Bow Tie” event on Dec. 20 to promote the fact that they carry men’s accessories as well, like bow ties, socks and scarves.</p>



<p>An event helps get exposure, Averette said. “It’s a great marketing strategy,” she said.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>One 4-year-old girl made the most of her school&#8217;s Christmas performance this holiday season.</p>



<p>In a now-viral video, little Stori stole the show when she took the microphone from her principal and made a rather bold — and hilarious — announcement.</p>



<p>“I am very proud of myself, and all of my other friends inside my class,” she began.</p>



<p>“And my class is really sweet,” Stori continued. “Except, one little boy. I need to tell you —“</p>







<p>As the audience burst out in laughter, the principal stifled her own laugh before taking the microphone back, and Stori headed off stage, all smiles.</p>



<p>Stori’s mom, Brenna Massa, tells TODAY.com that the 4-year-old’s confidence isn’t out the ordinary. In fact, Stori has always felt comfortable in the spotlight.</p>



<p>“She’s just got this personality,” Massa says of her daughter. “Wherever we go, she makes friends. Everybody always says she’s an old soul, just connects with people. She loves to dance. She’s loved to sing since she was tiny.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/ezgif-3-63dbb3c33b.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="Stori poses with her mom, Brenna" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Stori poses with her mom, Brenna. (Brenna Massa)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Massa says Stori has even been known to sing to random people at the grocery store.</p>



<p>“She’s not shy. She’s just not shy at all. She makes conversation with people,” Massa says, before adding, “She’s such a kind girl, but she’s also got that spunk and confidence that’s through the roof.”</p>



<p>Despite expecting this type of behavior from her daughter, Massa says she was still “shocked” to see Stori unexpectedly take the stage at the end of their school’s Christmas show.</p>



<p>“It was the end of the program, they were cleaning up. Everybody was kind of getting ready to go, and we’re like, ‘Where’d (Stori) go? She must be with her class.’ Then we see her going back up onstage and we’re like ‘Oh no,’” Massa recalls of the moment, with a laugh.</p>



<p>As her school principal made an announcement, Stori patiently waited for a turn to take the microphone, Massa says.</p>



<p>“We’re just like, ‘What is happening?’” Massa says, adding that they were “too far back to stop” Stori, so they opted to record the moment and hope for the best.</p>



<p>On social media, the clip has amassed millions of views as people can’t get enough of Stori’s confidence, with some waiting to hear what she was about to say next.</p>



<p>Massa posted the video — which was taken by Tara Easter, Stori’s classmate’s mom — to her now private Instagram account. The video has since been re-shared across the internet, including by former “Big Brother” contestant Kat Dunn.</p>



<p>“I wonder if he’s friends with Jessica. IYKYK,” one person commented on Massa’s post, referring to 6-year-old Miya Hayes’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/cute/little-girl-responds-to-being-called-fat-rcna178712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viral nickname for someone mean.</a></p>



<p>“HAHA OMG,” one person commented on Dunn’s post with the crying-laughing emoji. “her little walk off like ‘you’re right, I’ve said too much already.’”</p>



<p>Another wrote, “GIVE HER BACK THE MIC,” adding the crying-laughing emoji.</p>



<p>“‘And I need to tell you…’ WHAT!? What do you need to tell us!???” another commented of Stori’s final line before she was cut off.</p>



<p>As for what Stori was about to reveal, Massa says that her daughter&#8217;s lore with a boy in her class goes back to last year.</p>



<p>“I haven’t even heard about this kid in so long, so I was surprised she wanted to make this announcement,” Massa says.</p>



<p>Apparently, a classmate once made a loud noise, and Stori hasn’t let it go.</p>



<p>“She was terrified of (the noise),” Massa says, laughing. “Hopefully they can make up.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Bells are ringing. Snow is glistening. But you’re bummed out.</p>



<p>You could be suffering from a case of the holiday blues, which experts say is not uncommon. </p>



<p>A strained relationship with family, for example, can make this time of year pretty lonely. The holidays are expensive, and financial woes can cause major stress. Anxiety about holiday anything can fuel depression and worsen existing <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mental health</a> concerns.</p>



<p>“A lot of people at certain years can find the holidays to be more challenging than they have experienced in past years,” said Shilagh Mirgain, a psychologist at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin. “It’s important to recognize the common humanity that others, too, are struggling. </p>



<p>&#8220;You’re not alone.”</p>



<p>Here’s what experts say you can do to make your holiday season a little more bearable, if not cheery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If family time isn&#8217;t super fun, set boundaries</h2>



<p>Spending an extended amount of time with family is hard to avoid around the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holidays</a>, Mirgain said, but there are ways to make it a little easier.</p>



<p>“Certainly this year, I think with the recent election, there’s a lot of divisiveness and discord, and you’re probably having to interact with family members that have really opposing beliefs,” she said. “That can bring up strong emotions.”</p>



<p>Think about the boundaries you want to set: What kind of contact do you want to have with your family and how long are you prepared to be around them?</p>



<p>It’s also important to give yourself permission to exit the event — and have some strategies in place, she said. For example, if you need some space, go on a walk or run some errands.</p>



<p>And if stressful conversations come up, have some language ready to go to draw your boundaries quickly and firmly.</p>



<p>“You could say, ‘Gosh, thanks for asking, but I don’t talk politics over the holidays,’” Mirgain suggested. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you have grief or are lonely, connect with others</h2>



<p>The holidays can be difficult for people who are grieving or don’t have anyone nearby with whom to celebrate. </p>



<p>“Loneliness and isolation can feel exacerbated during the holiday season when you look around and it seems like everyone’s getting together and you don’t have plans, or you’re not looking forward to your plans,” Mirgain said.</p>



<p>Find ways to connect with people if that’s something you’re craving, like scheduling calls with people across the country or volunteering in your community.</p>



<p>“There’s so much opportunity to give back during this time, and I think generosity is one of the best things we can do for our own well-being,” she said.</p>



<p>And if you’re grieving the death of someone close to you, the holidays can be the perfect time to reflect on that person&#8217;s legacy, said Dr. Ellen Lee, a geriatric psychiatrist at UC San Diego Health.</p>



<p>&#8220;Try to honor that person by visiting their grave site or doing something they really loved to do, and then find people to share those memories with,” Lee said. She also advises people not to tamp down feelings but let yourself grieve. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If money is making you anxious, reach out</h2>



<p>Gifts, dinners, decorations — it’s all a lot to keep track of around this time of year, and it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. Those extra expenses and get-togethers can put more stress on your mental health.</p>



<p>For milder symptoms of depression, anxiety or mood issues, lean on tried-and-true methods of self-care, experts said, such as spending time doing something you love or watching a movie.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s important to reach out for help if you start to feel mounting financial anxiety or intensifying symptoms that impair your ability to function. Early intervention can keep them from intensifying, Mirgain said, adding that if you have suicidal thoughts, reach out to your provider. You can also call or text 988 or chat at 988Lifeline.org.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you are overwhelmed, set realistic expectations</h2>



<p>Remember, your holidays don’t have to be a Hallmark movie. Give yourself permission to do it differently this year, Lee said.</p>



<p>“We have so many goals, so many targets,” she said. “Getting all the gifts, decorating the house perfectly … sometimes it’s helpful to sort of focus on the most important part of it.”</p>



<p>That can look different depending on who you are: The most important part may be spending time with people you don’t get to see often, or having a nice meal with your favorite foods. </p>



<p>Lee emphasized that it is fine to have a low-key celebration.</p>



<p>“I ask people, ‘What’s the best part of the holiday?’&#8221; she said, &#8220;It’s not usually about the decorations or all these extra things that we all spend a lot of time worrying about.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Christmas jammies are definitely a &#8220;thing.&#8221; </p>



<p>They may be seen as silly and maybe a little odd but it&#8217;s a bonding experience for families and a way to announce you&#8217;re all part of the same crew. </p>



<p>With all the hustle and bustle of the season, it&#8217;s a special time when family can come together to just enjoy each other&#8217;s company. Whether your family comprises of two people or a large family with multiple siblings, cousins, uncles and aunts, everyone can be included in this tradition. </p>



<p>Matching family pajamas give everyone a strong sense of belonging and make for an extra sweet photo opp! </p>



<p>At the bottom of the article, you&#8217;ll find a list of retailers that offer matching family pajamas. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When did this tradition start?</h2>



<p>While some may think this is a new trend, it&#8217;s actually been around for decades. Stemming from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/the-curious-history-of-mommy-and-me-fashion/560240/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/the-curious-history-of-mommy-and-me-fashion/560240/" target="_blank">mommy-and-me fashions</a> popularized in the 1930s and &#8217;40s, it wasn&#8217;t until the late &#8217;50s that dads started to join in on the fun. </p>



<p>According to fashion historian <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vintagedancer.com/about-the-vintage-dancer/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://vintagedancer.com/about-the-vintage-dancer/" target="_blank">Debbie Sessions</a>, matching Christmas pajamas for the entire family date back to 1957. Department store catalogs advertised festive sleepwear featuring stripes, checks, and other holiday motifs for the whole family and the tradition gradually grew in popularity.</p>







<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Who popularized matching family pajamas?</h2>



<p>The age of social media helped solidify the tradition but a YouTube family and their viral video is credited for catapulting #christmasjammies into what it is today. </p>



<p>In 2013, the Holderness family from North Carolina posted their year in review to the tune of Will Smith&#8217;s &#8220;Welcome to Miami.&#8221; Donning red and green striped pajamas embroidered with their names across their chests, they sang &#8220;wearing my Christmas jammies.&#8221; </p>



<p>Ten years later, the video has amassed 18 million views and the hashtag #ChristmasJammies has over 200K posts on Instagram. </p>







<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How does this tradition go?</h2>



<p>The best part about holiday pajamas is that they&#8217;re pajamas. They&#8217;re casual, comfortable, and perfect for lounging around at home. There aren&#8217;t any special rules and you can pick and choose what works best for your family. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When should you wear Christmas pajamas?</h2>



<p>The debate over when to break out the Christmas pajamas is not unlike the debate over when to break out the Christmas tree. You might want them to be worn as much as possible if you have a child that will only be in their current size for this season. In that case, you might give them their Christmas pajamas the day after Thanksgiving or on December 1st. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re all about the &#8216;gram, you might want to save the Christmas pajamas for Christmas Eve. Everyone will be picture-perfect in the morning as they gather around the tree in their crisp, new PJs. </p>



<p>Waiting til Christmas Eve also provides the perfect opportunity to give them out as a gift. For kids, pair their family pajamas with a book to help them wind down as they wait in anticipation for Santa&#8217;s arrival. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great tradition because it doesn&#8217;t require much effort and everyone can participate (even pets!). Just put them on the night before and roll out of bed. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Are matching holiday PJs just for those that celebrate Christmas?</h2>



<p>No! You can find matching family pajamas to celebrate <a href="https://www.hannaandersson.com/new-occasion-hanukkah/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hannaandersson.com/family-match-holiday-hanukkah/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hanukkah</a>, <a href="https://pjsfortheculture.com/products/happy-kwanza-infant?variant=43487853805807&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoq9VjeChebd8XLPjMw9DDYhho6mQcyfPzfLOLmekRLrGdVIp2xakKg&amp;gQT=1" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.diyanu.com/products/abeje-kids-unisex-african-print-pajama-shirt-purple-mint-kente?pr_prod_strat=use_description&amp;pr_rec_id=4876304d8&amp;pr_rec_pid=7542882795690&amp;pr_ref_pid=7857590796458&amp;pr_seq=uniform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kwanzaa</a>, and <a href="https://cloverbabyandkids.com/products/long-sleeve-pajama-set-diwali-celebration?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Webtopia%20|%20PM%20-%20Pajamas%20(no%20assets)&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAmfq6BhAsEiwAX1jsZ232zt759Ef7PvbLrXWOpc7T3kpoYQpipECveizibSAvlUKucAy43hoCqMYQAvD_BwE" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wearlark.com/products/diwali-adult-unisex-pajamas-in-royal-march-sapphire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diwali</a>. </p>



<p>Those that observe non-religious traditions can also find matching family pajamas with winter themes, animals, gnomes and other creative prints. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Do we have to match?</h2>



<p>Matching family pajamas are super fun and great for those annual holiday cards but you don&#8217;t all have to be matchy-matchy. Color coordinating with reds, whites and greens, for instance, is a great option. Or go for some flannel plaid pajamas for a cohesive and classic look that will keep everyone cozy all winter long. </p>

<p>The Upper Darby Police Department stepped up and stepped out on Sunday morning as officers joined students from Stonehurst Hills Elementary School for its second annual &#8220;Presents with Police&#8221; event.</p>



<p>During the morning, police officials said, 27 students with the elementary school were given $150 gift cards to purchase gifts for the holiday season as they shopped with officers.</p>



<p> Officials said the event was intended as a way to &#8220;strengthen the bond between law enforcement and the community we serve, fostering positive interactions and trust.&#8221;</p>



<p>The event was hosted, for the second time, at by The Burlington Coat Factory, located along the 100 block of S. 69th Street in Upper Darby. </p>

<p>Long weekends offer a perfect excuse to get away from your day-to-day life and unwind, and in 2025, there are several of them.</p>



<p>Six federal holidays fall on a Monday this upcoming year, according to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/federal-holidays/#url=2025" target="_blank">U.S. Officer of Personnel Management</a>, and the <a href="http://tag/fourth-of-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fourth of July</a> is on a Friday. </p>



<p>According to Expedia&#8217;s annual <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.expedia.com/newsroom/expedia-report-finds-americans-win-the-gold-medal-for-taking-fewest-vacation-days-globally/" target="_blank">Vacation Deprivation Report</a>, American employees receive the fewest days of paid leave globally — on average, first-year employees receive 11 paid vacation days and fifth-year employees receive 15, the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ebs/notices/2023/paid-sick-leave-paid-vacation-and-consolidated-leave-plan-provisions-in-the-united-states-december-2022.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Bureau of Labor</a> found — and less than half of Americans planned to use all of them in 2024. </p>



<p>Though employers don&#8217;t always give federal holidays off, most schools do. Taking advantage of them can extend some vacations to up to nine days while only using three or four days of paid time off.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how to turn 16 days of PTO into 55 days of vacation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Which federal holidays fall on a Monday in 2025?</h2>



<p>In 2025, six federal holidays fall on a Monday, though Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Inauguration Day both fall on Jan. 20.</p>



<ul>
<li>Monday, Jan. 20: Martin Luther King, Jr.&#8217;s Birthday</li>



<li>Monday, Feb. 17: George Washington&#8217;s Birthday, or Presidents&#8217; Day</li>



<li>Monday, May 26: <a href="http://tag/memorial-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Memorial Day</a></li>

<p><em>Editor’s note: This story may contain spoilers for prying little eyes!</em></p>



<p>Thinking of a new and creative Elf on the Shelf idea every day can be an exhausting task on top of the hustle and bustle of the holiday season.</p>



<p>Not to fear, team TODAY.com is here to provide you with all sorts of last-minute Elf on the Shelf ideas to make the holidays magical for your little ones. From&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/parents/easy-elf-shelf-ideas-rcna181393" target="_blank">quick&nbsp;and easy ideas</a>&nbsp;to funny ones, we&#8217;ve got you covered.</p>



<p>Here are some ideas to keep in your back pocket for the moments when life gets a little too hectic and you need a quick, fun last-minute pose for your elf.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>1. Elf attack on the measuring tapes</strong></h2>







<p>Perhaps your elf snuck into the toolbox overnight and decided to take&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C0-60paOQD4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the measuring tape on a little joy ride</a>. Just grab the measuring tape, unroll it to whatever desired length, wrap your elf around it and secure it to the door with some tape. Bonus points if you can add some fuzzy little friends on top of the door cheering the elf on!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>2. Sprinkle snack monsters</strong></h2>







<p>Looks like your elf got a little hungry overnight. And what’s a better snack then sprinkles? This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCt2p0FuXmQ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simple design</a>&nbsp;can be easily created by dipping a piece of clear tape in a cup of whatever sprinkles are left over from this year’s holiday baking extravaganza. Then place the tape with sprinkles falling from your water dispenser and put the cup of sprinkles directly underneath. The final step is to position your elf friend right next to the cup, caught red-sprinkle-handed in action!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>3. Spidey senses</strong></h2>







<p>If you’ve got a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXf2hfiK27m/" target="_blank">Spider-Man</a>&nbsp;fan at home, this elf set-up will make them squeal with delight. All you’ll need is a DIY Spidey mask (easy to make with paper and markers) and some string to get your Santa spy swinging upside-down from a light fixture.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>4. Twist and shout!</strong></h2>







<p>Get all the stuffed animals involved in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BaYO6RwDMnl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">homemade game of Twister</a>. Aside from a DIY Twister board (colorfully placed dots on a piece of printer paper or created with a marker), this scene only requires a few stuffed friends and a DIY spinner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>5. Sentenced to Jenga jail</strong></h2>







<p>If your elf has been particularly mischievous this year, have them get caught in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DB_a5tFxwbn/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenga jail</a>. Arrange the Jenga blocks in any order you feel most creative around the elf, depicting the perfect moment of chaos it got frozen in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>6. &#8230;And a family elf on a Christmas tree.</strong></h2>







<p>Sometimes the simplest solution is the best one. Just walk down the steps and put the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ClmOU2ysqgU/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">elf on the tree</a>. No need to overthink this one!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>7. Naughty or nice?</strong></h2>







<p>Search your pantry for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAYv_pvpkH1/?igsh=bTlsc3Y4djkwczc3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some cake pops or your kid&#8217;s favorite treat</a>&nbsp;and have your elf present it to your child in the morning. This time, your elf decided to be nice instead of naughty.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>8. Clean freak</strong></h2>







<p>Finally, the family elf is pulling his or her weight around the house &#8230; sort of. Put your Santa spy on an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXngVoZqKzq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">automatic vacuum</a>&nbsp;and let them go for a short spin in the morning. No Roomba? No problem! Attach your elf to a mop, stand-up vacuum or broom.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>9. Sprinkle snow angel</strong></h2>



<p>Missing a white Christmas outside? Have your elf create their own snowy fun inside instead. Just grab some sprinkles and pour them in a pile on the counter, add your elf in the center and push the sprinkles aside to mimic the process of making a snow angel. It&#8217;s a quick, simple and sweet twist to bring a fun snow activity inside this winter.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>10. Flossy, flossy</strong></h2>







<p>Whether your kids are flossing their teeth or doing a dance, this fun elf scene requires&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXd1zhrloqe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dental floss and a tiny sign</a>. You’ll get cool parent points for knowing how to floss!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>11. Invisible elf</strong></h2>







<p>If your elf&#8217;s clothes remove easily, this idea is a great creative solution to mix things up this Christmas. Simply tape your elf&#8217;s hat the wall, accompanied by a sign telling your little one that they&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DC9_IzMSqp9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned invisible</a>! It&#8217;s the perfect example of Santa&#8217;s magic!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>12. Let there be light</strong>!</h2>







<p>Don&#8217;t forget to look up, especially when it comes to finding the elf each day. At least once a week,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXLzy-qOgs5" target="_blank">hang your elf</a>&nbsp;from a light fixture or fan to give your kids a new perspective.</p>

<p>A fresh-cut Christmas tree can offer a magical experience in the home <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/holidays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this time of year</a>. The distinct smell of pine from a real tree makes for lasting memories &#8212; and even makes picking up pine needles all over the house worthwhile.</p>



<p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind so your Christmas tree is as fresh as can be through the holiday.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Make sure it has plenty of water</h2>



<p>First and foremost, water is the most important thing. Make sure the base of your tree has an adequate supply.</p>



<p>As a general rule, the water reservoir should hold one quart of water for every inch of diameter of the stem. Keep this water replenished daily and make sure it doesn&#8217;t fall below the base of the tree. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Avoid certain cuts to the tree trunk</h2>



<p>Avoid whittling the outer bark to fit the stand.</p>



<p>This outer layer is the most efficient at soaking up the water. Cut flat across the trunk and not at an angle. </p>



<p>Don&#8217;t drill into the tree either, as this is not a proven method to increase water uptake. The temperature of the water makes no difference in uptake.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Your lighting is important, too</h2>



<p>Make sure your lights are in good working order before placing them on the tree. Be sure to replace any strands of lights that appear worn. </p>



<p>Don&#8217;t overload any outlets (picture that scene from &#8220;A Christmas Story.&#8221;)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s best to use lights that produce a low amount of heat. And it&#8217;s good practice to turn off the lights (unplug) before leaving the house.</p>



<p>Finally, consider placing your tree far enough away from any heat source such as a furnace or fireplace so as not to dry it out more.</p>



<p>When it&#8217;s time to remove the tree from your home, consider a local recycling program in your area. Don&#8217;t burn any part of the tree in your fireplace.</p>

<p>When faced with last minute gift shopping stress, changing weather, and hectic family visits, it&#8217;s common to turn to your two best friends for comfort during the holidays — Ben &amp; Jerry’s.</p>



<p>While the holiday season may cause you to indulge in your go-to comfort foods, experts advise that mindful eating should also have a seat at the table. Unless you’re including nutrient-dense foods on your plate, excessive eating around the holidays may actually hurt you in the long run, Dr. Eva Selhub, a physician specializing in mind-body medicine, tells TODAY.com.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200003233421206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research shows</a>&nbsp;that weight gained during the holidays is usually not lost and can even account for more than 50% of total weight gain throughout the year. This can increase the risk for heart disease, diabetes, respiratory issues and more.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there are ways to still enjoy your favorite treats without long-term health consequences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why do food cravings spike during the holidays?</strong></h2>



<p>People are most likely consume large amounts of high-calorie foods while exercising the least during the fall and winer,&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1428793/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research shows</a>.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s in part because the holiday season sends a message to our bodies to eat a lot simply out of habit, Joan Salge Blake, registered dietitian and professor at Boston University, tells TODAY.com.</p>



<p>“We all were born with a unique desire for sweets, but there’s also a psychological and physiological thing going on,” Blake explains. “The psychological is the memories and habits. When the holidays come around, it’s just all these memories of wonderful food.”</p>



<p>Celebrations, such as Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year&#8217;s, where sugary drinks, desserts and alcohol are front and center, beckon our bodies to participate and also release certain hormones, Selhub notes.</p>



<p>“The excitement and the nervousness that comes around both create cortisol and adrenaline release,” Selhub says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cortisol is the hormone in the body that is directly responsible for handling stress. When stress hormones are released, the body then has to cope with the heightened excitement or anxiety.</p>



<p>“So, if you don’t have coping mechanisms put into place, you’re going to go to the one that’s easiest, which is food,” Blake adds.</p>



<p>Alongside the release of stress hormones, another culprit for increased food cravings during the holidays can be a lack of sleep.</p>



<p>“When you don’t sleep, there is an increase of a hormone called ghrelin. It’s known as the hunger hormone,” Blake says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seasonal cravings and stress</strong></h2>



<p>After you eat your favorite winter treats or comfort foods, you may experience temporary stress relief, followed by fatigue or even increased anxiety.</p>



<p>“Food is a coping mechanism, and it does relieve stress. It’s just what we call maladaptive,” Selhub explains.</p>



<p>Maladaptive coping is when the body responds to stress by using ineffective strategies, such as substance use, to handle difficult emotions. Selhub says food can act like a numbing agent.</p>



<p>“Eating is helping me cope, but it’s not actually solving the problem of why I’m anxious. I’m just coping and ignoring,&#8221; Selhub explains.</p>



<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6381575/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research</a>&nbsp;shows that consuming foods you love can raise dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, temporarily turning off your stress responses and enabling you eat more. However, while the body’s stress response may be turned off, the underlying cause of the stress is still present.</p>



<p>Selhub recommends habits like meditation, breathing techniques, walking and mindfulness practices to keep yourself feeling balanced through the holidays and other stressful periods.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to control cravings while keeping the holiday cheer</strong></h2>



<p>You don’t have to sacrifice your favorite holiday foods in order to keep your mind and body healthy this time of year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the experts say the goal shouldn’t be to completely ignore your cravings but rather to integrate the foods you want into your daily nutrition goals.</p>



<p>Here are some tips to satisfy your cravings in a healthy way this holiday season.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Find healthy ways to manage holiday stress</h2>



<p>Instead of numbing the body through maladaptive coping mechanisms, nurture your body with stress-relieving activities.</p>



<p>Meditation, counseling, spending time with loved ones and going for walks are all activities that can help us feel more nurtured.</p>



<p>“It’s not necessarily going to take the craving away, but it’s going to soften it,” Selhub says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Incorporate some healthy holiday swaps</strong></h2>



<p>Food swaps that are enjoyable but also nutrient-rich are key to controlling cravings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Let’s take what Mother Nature has given us for sweets, and that’s fruit. So let’s make &#8230; dessert more fruit based,” Blake suggests.</p>



<p>Chocolate fondue with an accompanying fruit platter is a great way to enjoy a sweet treat at a holiday party with a nutritious base. To top it off, try Greek yogurt instead of heavy or whipped cream.</p>



<p>“It’s full of fiber and water because of the fruits there, so (it&#8217;s) more likely to fill you up before it fills you out, but you still have that sweet chocolate taste,&#8221; Blake adds.</p>



<p>Vegetable chips that you can pop into the air fryer with very little oil are also a great substitute when looking for something salty.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Try eating mindfully&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>When you enjoy less nutritious food over the holidays, do so with intention and savor it to help delay future cravings, the experts say.</p>



<p>“Savor the smells, the taste, the aromas, the experience,” Selhub advises. “Eat it mindfully and &#8230; enjoy it. Shame is going cause just as much inflammation as the food.”</p>



<p>Being mindful around the holidays also means not skipping meals, which helps you more easily control your hunger.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t want to skip meals because when your blood sugars go down, there’s a need to bring them back up with carbohydrates or a grab-and-go (snack),” Blake says. “Those food choices are most likely not going to be the most healthy.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sleep enough</h2>



<p>Adequate sleep can help you control cravings.&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4034047/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research</a>&nbsp;shows that a good night’s sleep can increase satiety, or feeling full and satisfied.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Don’t fall into a shame cycle</strong></h2>



<p>Instead of counting calories, prioritize finding joy in celebrating the holidays with beloved friends and food.</p>



<p>“The first thing that I like to tell people is don’t shame yourself,” Selhub says. “And don’t be looking at calories because that&#8217;s just going to make you feel worse, (and) then you’re back in the cycle.”</p>



<p>Instead of putting yourself down for craving comfort food, look for ways take in the deliciousness of the season, in moderation.</p>



<p>“This is grandma’s pecan pie. For goodness gracious, enjoy it,” Blake quips.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The commencement of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holiday season</a>&nbsp;often means the lengthening of to-do lists.</p>



<p>There are lights to hang,&nbsp;cards to mail,&nbsp;cookies to bake&nbsp;and, of course,&nbsp;gifts to buy. Gift exchanges, whether they’re among friends, family or co-workers, can be a fun way to get in the holiday spirit. But can also be another stressor during a busy time of year.</p>



<p>Secret Santa exchanges — where participants are assigned a gift recipient and tasked with finding them a perfect present within a price limit — sometimes mean that those in friend groups are paired with “frenemies,” someone inevitably draws themselves, or colleagues who are virtually strangers are matched up.</p>



<p>Those possible pitfalls inspired Peter Imburg to create&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elfster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elfster</a>, a free online Secret Santa organizer, after he saw the time and effort it took to coordinate the logistics of a gift exchange with his family over 20 years ago.</p>



<p>More top-down organization, he says, helps things run more smoothly.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Say goodbye to picking names from a hat</h2>



<p>Elfster, for instance, creates pairings, asks for wish lists, offers gift suggestions at different price points and sends reminders, among other features meant to make the organizational hurdles of a gift exchange less daunting.</p>



<p>“The organizer is like the hero. They make it all happen,&#8221; Imburg said, adding that his site aims &#8220;to make it a lot easier for the organizer to do that with a minimal amount of effort.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Reliable gift ideas</h2>



<p>Cameron Rogers, a New Jersey-based social media content creator and&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2HBg1dRKc8Gs4U4wpsXCU1?si=16ea864c98864b07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast host</a>&nbsp;on wellness and motherhood, understands the stress that gift exchanges can bring up.</p>



<p>“Having to give generic gifts to people I’m not necessarily close with is extremely difficult,” Rogers said. “I can pick a good gift for my husband or my kids or my mom, but for people who I don’t know the ins and outs of their lives, I think it’s hard to pick something that you know they’re actually going to enjoy.”</p>



<p>She recently shared a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCrUj48pwoG/?igsh=MW04MWdydmIwZHBjag%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide to Secret Santa gifts under $50</a>&nbsp;on her social media channels, emphasizing how challenging it can be to find something within a set price range that will be well-received.</p>



<p>Gifts with a specific purpose&nbsp;— kitchen gadgets, home items or winter gear — and gifts that have a personalized aspect like a monogram are good go-to options for anyone feeling lost after receiving their Secret Santa assignment, she said.</p>



<p>Imburg said the “gift gurus” at Elfster also have suggestions, especially for recipients who aren’t offering any clues as to what they’d like. In a similar vein as Rogers, the Elfster team offered ideas for some practical gifts, like water bottles, blankets and massage guns. Other no-nonsense home and kitchen items, like food storage containers, charging stations and more are featured on the site’s “Top Trending Gift Ideas for 2024” list.</p>



<p>Gift cards, although they are not particularly glamorous, are an essentially foolproof option, Rogers said, and they won’t leave your recipient wondering where they’ll find room on their shelf for another mug or book.</p>



<p>“I don’t want to give someone something solely to check a box,” Rogers said. “I want them to enjoy it, instead of being like, ‘What do I do with this now?’”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Embrace Secret Santa as a stress reliever, instead</h2>



<p>Some gift-givers find that Secret Santa (and its many counterparts like White Elephant and Yankee Swap) actually cuts down on stress and spending, as it&#8217;s often done in place of giving individual presents to each member of a group.</p>



<p>Nicole Troiano of Cranston, Rhode Island, finds them to be a fun way to handle holidays with large groups — even if co-workers may need to ask around to get specifics on their assigned person.</p>



<p>“It’s fun to do it that way and think about something that would be good for that person,” she said. “And then, when they open it, they’re like, ‘Oh my God!’”</p>



<p>By the weekend after Thanksgiving, Troiano had already purchased and wrapped her gift for the exchange she’s taking part in this year. After her swap, a lucky participant will be the new owner of a cutting board, two bottles of wine wearing bottle-size ugly sweaters, and gourmet chocolates.</p>

<p>One city in South Jersey is spreading holiday cheer by offering free parking. </p>



<p>From Monday, Dec. 16, 2024, through Wednesday, Jan. 1, 2025, meter parking throughout all of Camden will be free. </p>



<p>During this time, Camden Parking Authority Officers will not enforce curbside meter parking. However, they will continue to enforce illegal parking in handicapped parking areas, along yellow no-parking curb lines, in tow-away zones, and vehicles blocking fire hydrants and sidewalks.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s as cuddly as a cactus and could be described as a bad banana with a greasy black peel and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lindenwoldpd.opsnetwork.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://lindenwoldpd.opsnetwork.org/" target="_blank">police in South Jersey are looking for him</a>.</p>



<p>Officers with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/@LindenwoldPD/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/@LindenwoldPD/" target="_blank">Lindenwold Police Department are asking for the public&#8217;s help</a> to find the mean one known as the Grinch. </p>



<p>He&#8217;s been spotted around town in recent weeks.</p>



<p>He was seen trying to break into the Lindenwold School #5 last week and at one of the local grocery stores stealing a roast beast on Thursday, Dec. 5.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="688" height="806" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/grinch-roast-beast-facebook.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all&#038;strip=all&#038;resize=688%2C806" alt="" class="wp-image-10090507" srcset="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/grinch-roast-beast-facebook.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=688&amp;strip=all 688w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/grinch-roast-beast-facebook.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=256&amp;strip=all 256w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Police even went to Lindenwold School #4 to warn students there to keep a look out for the one who is accused of having termites in his smile. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="691" height="847" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/lindenwold-police-grinch-students.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all&#038;strip=all&#038;resize=691%2C847" alt="" class="wp-image-10090505" srcset="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/lindenwold-police-grinch-students.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=691&amp;strip=all 691w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/lindenwold-police-grinch-students.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=245&amp;strip=all 245w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>He&#8217;s green and was last seen impersonating Santa Claus by wearing a red jacket and hat trimmed with white fur. </p>



<p>If you see this foul one, don&#8217;t touch him with a thirty-nine-and-a-half-foot pole. Please leave a tip with the Lindenwold Police Department <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cityprotect.com/forms/lindenwoldpd.com/anonymous?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2zGoCXXX31cxxea7WEnqc6LKNaL2eGoDAQDMVPiC3Wa9tcRm7ol74c5G8_aem_l6tHMDg5corn3-ZzJsvHwA" data-type="link" data-id="https://cityprotect.com/forms/lindenwoldpd.com/anonymous?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2zGoCXXX31cxxea7WEnqc6LKNaL2eGoDAQDMVPiC3Wa9tcRm7ol74c5G8_aem_l6tHMDg5corn3-ZzJsvHwA" target="_blank">by clicking here</a>. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What is the origin story of the Christmas stocking?</h2>



<p>Legend has it that a 4th-century nobleman was a widower with three daughters and could not afford their dowries. Hearing of this father&#8217;s dilemma, Saint Nicholas secretly tossed three gold spheres down the man&#8217;s chimney because he knew the man would not accept any charity. The gold spheres ended up in the daughters&#8217; stockings, which were hanging above the fireplace to dry. </p>



<p>With the gold, the daughters were now eligible to marry and the father was so overjoyed, he eventually found out who had left the gold and told everyone about Nicholas. </p>



<p>While this far-fetched tale is difficult to believe, the myth is widely accepted as the origin story for the humble Christmas stocking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When did we begin hanging up stockings?</h2>



<p>In 1809, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/13042/13042-h/13042-h.htm" target="_blank">&#8220;Knickerbocker History of New York&#8221;</a> was written by Washington Irving. He detailed the custom of hanging up stockings &#8220;in the chimney on St. Nicholas Eve,&#8221; along with finding them in the morning having been &#8220;miraculously filled.&#8221;</p>



<p>In 1823, Clement Clark Moore wrote the poem,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.nightbeforechristmas.biz/poem.htm" target="_blank">&#8220;The Night Before Christmas,&#8221;</a> in which the famous line,&nbsp;&#8220;the stockings were hung by the chimney with care&#8221;&nbsp;is written.</p>



<p>An <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/12/26/106271284.html?pageNumber=4" target="_blank">1883 article in the New York Times</a> detailed issues with Christmas stockings of the time and how they were almost done away with completely in favor of the German Christmas trees, which allowed families to put as many or as few presents as they could afford underneath. </p>



<p>&#8220;The New England stocking, though admirably adapted for holding presents like paper cutters or knitting needles did not have sufficient room for the ordinary Christmas presents of even an economical home,&#8221; it reads. &#8220;On the other hand, the tonnage of the Western stocking &#8212; especially that of the Chicago type, was so great that it could not be filled except at a cost which few fathers of families could afford.&#8221; </p>



<p>They also took issue with the limp, unattractive appearance of the long, woolen stockings. </p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t until the introduction of decorated stockings with designs and colors that made them a thing of beauty, that people were happy to display them in their homes.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Smith Christmas Stocking&#8221; was then invented to address all these issues. Unlike the New England stocking and the Chicago stocking, this elastic stocking was specially designed to fit Christmas gifts of all budgets.</p>



<p>The inventor also fashioned it with a &#8220;water-tight metallic compartment&#8221; in the toe of the boot for things like molasses candy and other perishables.  </p>



<p>By the end of the 19th century, bright red felt stockings as we know them now began to be hung by the fire.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Why do some people put oranges in their stockings?</h2>







<p>There are a few reasons for the tradition of an orange in one&#8217;s Christmas stocking.</p>



<p>To honor the legend of St. Nicholas placing gold spheres in the maiden&#8217;s stockings, people began to gift oranges instead of gold.</p>



<p>Another reason is that the tradition of the Christmas stocking may have started during the Great Depression. Families couldn&#8217;t afford to buy presents and a fresh, sweet orange was a fruit that was hard to come by but an attainable luxury. </p>



<p>A third theory is that oranges represent the spirit of the season. Orange segments can be easily shared with others, thus embodying the spirit of giving. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Where can I find good stocking stuffers?</h2>



<p>To save on the cost of shipping, be more environmentally conscious and to support businesses in your community, it may be best to shop locally for your stocking stuffers. You can find items at your local Dollar Tree,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.target.com/c/stocking-stuffer-ideas/-/N-xv1j9" target="_blank">Target</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.walmart.com/tp/stocking-stuffers" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.walmart.com/shop/gift-finder?facet=gf_interests%3AStocking+stuffers&amp;max_price=5" target="_blank">Walmart</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/seasonal-shops/holiday/stocking-stuffers" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cvs.com/shop/seasonal-shops/holiday/stocking-stuffers" target="_blank">CVS</a>, other pharmacies, party supply stores or anywhere that sells small goods and trinkets.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The family of the widower Earl Albert who donated this year&#8217;s <a href="http://tag/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockefeller Center Christmas tree</a> is giving an update of his health after he&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/health/news/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-widower-stroke-rcna180052" target="_blank">suffered a stroke</a>.</p>



<p>Due to his health, Earl Albert wasn’t able to attend the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/life/holidays/live-blog/rockefeller-center-tree-lighting-2024-live-updates-rcna182504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting</a>&nbsp;on Dec. 4. His family, who did attend the tree lighting ceremony, appeared on TODAY Dec. 5 to reflect on the recent events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s doing OK,&#8221; Earl Albert&#8217;s daughter-in-law, Shawn, said of Earl Albert&#8217;s health. &#8220;He&#8217;s at Sunnyview Rehab so he&#8217;s working towards strength and wellness.&#8221;</p>



<p>In an interview with NBC’s Joe Fryer that aired on TODAY Dec. 5, Shawn Albert explained he&#8217;s still got some &#8220;medical hurdles to get over.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of attending the event in person, Earl Albert watched the event on TV. Shawn Albert noted on TODAY that Earl Albert had a “little watch party” in his room for the occasion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;He had his room decked out. He had his Santa hat on and my son FaceTimed with him, so he was able to sort of be here,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Earl Albert has also received &#8220;thousands&#8221; of holiday get-well letters from fans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shawn Albert&#8217;s husband and Earl Albert&#8217;s son, Michael, added that going to the tree lighting ceremony in person was an unforgettable experience.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was an overwhelming emotion of joy. It was a tribute to my mother&#8217;s life. Just the giving back and the loving nature of her. It was like our way to kind of give to the world. It&#8217;s awesome,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>In an&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/life/holidays/2024-rockefeller-christmas-tree-origin-story-rcna179306" target="_blank">interview with Fryer</a>&nbsp;that aired in early November, Earl Albert revealed why the holidays are so special for him.</p>



<p>He explained that he planted this year&#8217;s Christmas tree in 1967 at his home in West Stockbridge, Massachusetts, shortly after he and his late wife, Leslie Albert, got married.</p>



<p>Then, a few days after she died in 2020, Rockefeller Center’s head gardener, Erik Pauze, knocked on the Albert&#8217;s family door to ask if they would be interested in donating their tree for the holiday season.</p>



<p>“This is definitely her handiwork,” Shawn Albert said in the interview.</p>



<p>Earl Albert added that donating the tree is “probably one of the greatest honors” of his life.</p>



<p>He noted that attending the tree lighting ceremony was going to be very special for him because he&#8217;ll be thinking about Leslie Albert and &#8220;how much she enjoyed trees&#8221; and Christmastime.&nbsp;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The lights are bright at Rockefeller Center as the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/holidays/who-donated-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11-ton Norway Spruce</a> outside dazzles once again with tens of thousands of LED lights to mark the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holiday season</a>. </p>



<p>While Christmas and holiday decorations have been showing up in New York City over the past few weeks, none represents the start of the season and spirit of NYC than the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree.</p>



<p>This year&#8217;s tree is from <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">West Stockbridge, Massachusetts</a> &#8212; the first tree to come from that state since 1959. The tree is an 11-ton Norway Spruce that&#8217;s 74-feet tall and 43-feet wide. A Swarovski star crown sparkling with 3 million crystals will top it.</p>



<p>There are more than 50,000 multi-colored LED lights on the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, connected by approximately five miles worth of wire.</p>





<p>The annual Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree Lighting attracted more than just people. A few snow flurries came down during some star-studded performances next to the iconic skating rink. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the night&#8217;s performers:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kelly Clarkson</li>



<li>The Backstreet Boys</li>



<li>Dan + Shay</li>



<li>Megan Hilty</li>



<li>Jennifer Hudson</li>



<li>Coco Jones</li>



<li>Little Big Town</li>



<li>RAYE</li>



<li>Thalia</li>



<li>The Radio City Rockettes</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When is the Rockefeller Christmas tree lit every day?</h2>



<p>The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree is lit daily from 5 a.m. to midnight.</p>



<p>On Christmas Eve, the tree will be lit for an entire 24 hours, whereas on New Year&#8217;s Eve, the spruce will be illuminated from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How long will the Rockefeller Christmas tree be up?</h2>



<p>Rockefeller&#8217;s Christmas Tree will be on display to the public through mid-January 2025.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>What happens to the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree after it comes down?</strong></h2>



<p>The tree goes from providing Christmas joy to providing housing.</p>



<p>When the tree is taken down, it is laid in Rockefeller Plaza to be cut up and taken to a yard in New Jersey. There it is milled into two-by-four and two-by six beams and branded with a Rockefeller Center stamp. Tishman Speyer, the firm that owns and operates Rockefeller Center, then donates the lumber to Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit organization that helps to build and improve homes across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A fourth grader from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, is hoping you can help him make it possible to give back this holiday season. </p>



<p>James Katona of Plymouth Meeting set a goal of giving 500 new pajama sets to the kids at St. Christopher&#8217;s Hospital for Children.</p>



<p>When Katona was just 4 years old, he was badly hurt in an accident when he tripped on a cord and an industrial coffee urn fell on him leaving 13% of body with third degree burns. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think it was the hardest moment as a parent that we&#8217;ve ever faced,&#8221; his mother, Jamie Katona, said. </p>



<p>As a patient at St. Christopher&#8217;s, Katona was gifted pajamas that he got to wear during his stay to help him be comfortable, so now he wants to give back. </p>



<p>&#8220;People would bring in pajamas every year and that cheered me up a lot,&#8221; James said. </p>



<p>His recovery was long, but he made it through and is back with his friends, who call him Bubba, playing sports. </p>



<p>Bubba says that he&#8217;ll never forget what he went through and those who were there for him during that time of his life. </p>



<p>&#8220;Passing on the favor just feels right,&#8221; Bubba said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not that hard to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ever since his recovery, the Katonas have been collecting pajamas for other kids, and they say it&#8217;s just as exciting as Christmas morning. </p>



<p>&#8220;It kind of makes me feel, like, cool, because it&#8217;s random people that see what I&#8217;m doing and they think that it&#8217;s a good idea and they help me with it and all the people that do help me, really, it makes a difference,&#8221; Bubba told NBC10. </p>



<p>Every year they set a goal, and this year the goal is 500 sets and they already have over 300!</p>



<p>The family plans to deliver the donations to the hospital just before Christmas so if you would like to donate, you have plenty of time to help reach the goal. </p>



<p>Staff at St. Christopher&#8217;s says that the hospital needs newborn and plus sized pajama sets the most. </p>

<p>It was nearly 60 years ago that Earl and Lesley Albert put down roots.</p>



<p>Newlyweds living at their new home in West Stockbridge, Massachusetts, they went out to their front yard one day in 1967, dug a hole and planted a Norway Spruce that at the time stood about waist high.</p>



<p>There, alongside the Albert family driveway, it stood for decades.</p>



<p>Like any other tree, it blended into the backdrop despite being a constant through life&#8217;s many changing phases.</p>



<p>It was there in 1968 when the Alberts purchased the local grocery store Loeb&#8217;s Foodtown, greeting them each time they left for or returned from work over the next five decades. It was there years later when they brought their newborn son Michael home for the first time, growing as the family grew. It was there decades later when Michael married his wife Shawn and when their three children were born, providing shade over the years as the kids played in the sandbox beneath the tree at their grandparents&#8217; house.</p>



<p>It was there in 2020 when Lesley passed away at 78.</p>

<p>Two days after she died &#8212; and 53 years after the Alberts planted the tree &#8212; there was a knock on their front door by a person Michael later described to relatives as “an angel.”</p>



<p>The real angel, of course, was up above: the matriarch who adored her family, Christmas, and the tree in her front yard that she decorated for holidays, even the Fourth of July.</p>



<p>The person at the door was Erik Pauze, the head gardener at Rockefeller Center <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/holidays/meet-the-man-who-picks-the-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-each-year/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/holidays/meet-the-man-who-picks-the-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-each-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responsible for picking the plaza&#8217;s famed Christmas tree</a>. Earl and his daughter-in-law Shawn were in the yard when Pauze approached them to ask if they would be willing to donate their tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;We took it as a sign from my mother-in-law,&#8221; Shawn said, &#8220;just because she loved everything surrounding Christmas, the tree, all of it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Earl quickly agreed to donate the tree, <a href="https://www.today.com/life/holidays/2024-rockefeller-christmas-tree-origin-story-rcna179306" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.today.com/life/holidays/2024-rockefeller-christmas-tree-origin-story-rcna179306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later telling TODAY</a>, &#8220;I consider it probably one of the greatest honors of my life.&#8221;</p>



<p>That honor, he believes, would be shared by his wife, as her tree becomes an iconic Christmas symbol for millions to enjoy.</p>

<p>Pauze, <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/holidays/meet-the-man-who-picks-the-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-each-year/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/holidays/meet-the-man-who-picks-the-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-each-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who has selected each Rockefeller Center Christmas tree since 1995</a>, had been in the area that July to scout a nearby tree. While driving, he spotted the 74-foot, 11-ton tree towering over the Albert home.</p>



<p>&#8220;I saw this tree right in front of me coming down the road,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I knew I had to knock on the door.&#8221;</p>



<p>After he was introduced to Earl, he asked if he could take pictures of the tree.</p>



<p>&#8220;As I was walking around, the tree was perfect all the way around,&#8221; Pauze said. &#8220;I said, &#8216;Wow! This is beautiful.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Its beauty will be on full display Wednesday during the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/holidays/heres-the-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting-2024-time-and-schedule/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/holidays/heres-the-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting-2024-time-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockefeller Center Tree Lighting Ceremony on NBC</a>.</p>



<p>The tree was carefully cut down in November and lowered by crane <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting-4/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">onto a trailer for its 135-mile drive to Manhattan</a>.

<p>It marks a new beginning for the tree and the family, Michael said, calling it a tribute to his mom. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“She was a giving person,” he said of Lesley, who was also part-time school nurse for Berkshire Country Day School. “It would mean more to give it to the community, let everyone enjoy it. That’s what we are really excited about, is to go to New York City and let the world see it.”</p>



<p>Taking the place of the tree on the Albert property will be a memorial dedicated to Lesley with new plantings. For Lesley’s family, the Rockefeller Center tree lighting will also serve as a proper celebration of her life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“She passed in 2020, so it was Covid, and we weren’t able to have a funeral,” Shawn said. “And she was such a huge part of the community, so to me, this is like her gathering we finally get to have and that we finally get to honor her.”</p>

<p>When Lesley passed away, Earl moved into a new home and Michael, Shawn and their sons Andrew, Brendan and Evan moved into the Albert home – keeping the house, and the tree, in the family. Shortly after the family was announced as the donors of this year’s Rockefeller Center tree, they received a card from the McGinley family, <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/holidays/meet-the-family-who-donated-this-years-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/holidays/meet-the-family-who-donated-this-years-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who donated last year’s tree</a>.</p>



<p>“You’ll never forget the sound, the flip of the switch, and the roar of the crowd,” Shawn Albert recalled the note saying. “You’ll get chills, and just the emotion, it’s overwhelming emotion.&#8221;</p>



<p>It’s an emotion Earl hopes to witness in person, <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-donor-suffers-stroke/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-donor-suffers-stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having suffered a stroke</a> just weeks before the lighting.</p>



<p>“He is looking forward to the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting and working hard to be able to attend in person,&#8221; the family <a href="https://www.today.com/health/news/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-widower-stroke-rcna180052" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.today.com/health/news/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-widower-stroke-rcna180052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared in a statement with TODAY</a> on Nov. 13.</p>



<p>While the tree still stood on the Albert property earlier this year, Earl discussed the anticipated emotion of the moment.</p>



<p>“It will get to me, I&#8217;m sure,” <a href="https://www.today.com/life/holidays/2024-rockefeller-christmas-tree-origin-story-rcna179306" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.today.com/life/holidays/2024-rockefeller-christmas-tree-origin-story-rcna179306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he told TODAY</a>.</p>



<p>The roots of the tree that Earl and Lesley put down nearly 60 years ago have stretched from Massachusetts to New York City, where its branches represent a lifetime of memories that occurred beneath them. <br></p>



<p>Earl will be reminded of those moments when the 50,000 lights wrapping their tree are turned on for the first time in Rockefeller Center. Memories tend to shine brightest when they’re brought back by the simple flip of a switch.</p>



<p>So, what exactly will Earl be thinking of when that time finally comes?</p>



<p>&#8220;Lesley,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How much she enjoyed trees. How much she enjoyed Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was crumby for chef Tommy Banks when his van containing $30,000 worth of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/pie-making-tools-ncna1284099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pies</a>&nbsp;was stolen, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/texas-family-who-sold-tacos-from-their-home-now-in-michelin-guide-225564229689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelin</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/texas-family-who-sold-tacos-from-their-home-now-in-michelin-guide-225564229689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8211;</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/texas-family-who-sold-tacos-from-their-home-now-in-michelin-guide-225564229689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starred</a>&nbsp;chef has appealed to the thieves to donate them to people in need.</p>



<p>“I know you’re a criminal, but maybe just do something nice because it’s Christmas and maybe we can feed a few thousand people with these pies that you’ve stolen, do the right thing,” Banks said in an Instagram video Monday, shortly after they were taken.</p>



<p>The refrigerated van was filled with 2,500 pies with a variety of fillings including steak and ale, turkey and butternut squash, Banks said.</p>



<p>Staff went in the “morning to pick up the van and it has been stolen,” from the business park in Ripon, a cathedral city in northern Britain, he said. He added that it had been “plugged in overnight” to keep the pies fresh.</p>



<p>He added that he had planned to sell the pies at a pop-up stall in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/king-richard-iii-william-shakespeare-voice-avatar-technology-rcna180580" target="_blank">nearby city of York</a>.</p>







<p>Admitting that it was unlikely they would return the vehicle, he said the thieves<strong>&nbsp;</strong>should “drop the pies off somewhere” so they can be given “to people who need food and they are not wasted.”</p>



<p>“I know they’ve gone now and we obviously aren’t going to recover them to sell them,” he added. “I just think that’s 2,500 people we could feed and there’s a lot of people who could do with a hot meal right now. If we can find them, they can have them.”</p>



<p>Banks, a veteran judge on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/netflix-s-great-british-baking-show-has-new-winner-perhaps-ncna1075266" target="_blank">British cooking show</a>&nbsp;&#8220;The Great British Menu,&#8221; asked any members of the public who are offered pies with his branding from someone who is not him to report them to the police.</p>



<p>NBC News has contacted North Yorkshire Police for comment.</p>



<p>He had a less forgiving message for the thieves themselves.</p>



<p>“I hope you don’t get any presents this Christmas,” he said in a separate post on his personal and business Instagram accounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1410655/kieran-culkin-shares-why-he-wont-let-his-kids-watch-brother-macaulay-culkins-home-alone-movies">E! Online</a></em></p>



<p>There’s one obvious holiday classic that has yet to play in Kieran Culkin’s home.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Succession&#8221; star — who shares daughter Kinsey, 5, and son Wilder, 3, with wife Jazz Charton — revealed why he’s hesitant to introduce his children to &#8220;Home Alone,&#8221; the 1990 hit which starred their uncle <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/macaulay_culkin" target="_blank">Macaulay Culkin</a> in his breakout role.</p>



<p>“There’s still some scary parts,” Kieran Culkin explained to E! News Dec. 2 at The Gothams 34<sup>th</sup> Annual Film Awards in New York. “For the 3-year-old, there’s the tarantula [and] there’s the guy at the end who said, ‘I’m gonna bite off all your fingers.’ That’s scary for a 3-year-old.” </p>



<p>However, the actor says there’s only one way to find out.</p>



<p>“We think they might be ready for &#8216;Home Alone&#8217; this year,” he revealed. “If not, next year.”</p>



<p>While the Christmas favorite sparks nostalgia for most viewers, Kieran Culkin previously recalled how the film’s massive success made his brother an overnight sensation — a status he <a href="https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1369762/how-kieran-culkin-felt-about-macaulay-culkins-home-alone-fame">did not envy</a>.</p>



<p>“Even at that time, as a kid, I remember thinking, ‘That sucks for him,’” Kieran Culkin told <a href="https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1369762/how-kieran-culkin-felt-about-macaulay-culkins-home-alone-fame">Esquire</a> in March 2023. “Poor f&#8211;king guy. He was little and having to try to accept that level of fame as reality.”</p>



<p>But as for Macaulay Culkin himself, the former child star didn’t wait long to screen the movie for his son Dakota, 3, whom he shares with fiancée Brenda Song.</p>



<p>“I already showed it to him last year, he thinks it&#8217;s so funny,” Macaulay Culkin said in a 2023 interview with <a href="https://www.etonline.com/macaulay-culkin-interview-home-alone-exclusive-215808">Entertainment Tonight</a>. “I convinced my oldest that he&#8217;s the kid in the movie. I said, ‘Remember you had yellow hair? Remember when you were getting the bad guys?’ He&#8217;s like, ‘Yeah!’ He is such a liar. I&#8217;m like, ‘You don&#8217;t remember any of that.’”</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the final holiday stretch for <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/Joe-biden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Joe Biden</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/jill-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his wife, Jill</a>, who has decked out the White House with some whimsical decorations to evoke the “peace and light” of the season. </p>



<p>The festive display includes <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a towering Christmas tree</a> surrounded by an amusement park-style carousel, brass-colored bells and sleigh bells lining a hallway, and a ceiling design that mimics snowfall. </p>



<p>The first lady invited National Guard families to be among the first members of the public to see the decorations, which are based on the theme of “A Season of Peace and Light.” She also spoke at a separate event held to thank the volunteers who helped with the monumental job of decorating the interior and exterior of the White House.</p>



<p>“This would not be possible without your work,” she said. “It&#8217;s been incredible to watch all of you transform this space year after year, and you traded time with families for hours of gluing.”</p>



<p>More than 300 volunteers spent the past week decorating the White House&#8217;s public spaces and its 83 Christmas trees with nearly 10,000 feet of ribbon, more than 28,000 ornaments, over 2,200 paper doves and some 165,000 lights used on wreaths, garlands and other displays. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/GettyImages-2187887671.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="A carousel surrounds the White House Christmas Tree during a media preview of the 2024 holiday decorations at the White House  on Dec. 2, 2024, in Washington, D.C.

<p>The official White House tree, a towering Fraser fir from North Carolina that was anchored to the ceiling of the Blue Room after a chandelier was removed, sits at the center of a colorful carousel with reindeer, swans and other animals bobbing up and down on poles. The tree is awash in twinkling multicolored lights and three-dimensional holiday sweets like peppermints and ribbon candies. It also sports the names of every U.S. state, territory and the District of Columbia. </p>



<p>Guests enter the White House beneath a rotating starlight and quickly come upon the Gold Star tree, honoring the families of fallen service members. The tree is made of six gold-toned stars, one for each of the six branches of the military, stacked one on top of the other.</p>



<p>The bells lining the East Colonnade hallway are meant to symbolize the sounds of the holidays. The ceiling and windows upstairs in the East Room are covered with reflective decorations designed to create the feeling of snow falling. Silhouettes of people holding hands decorate the bases of two large Christmas trees that flank the center door of the room.</p>



<p>Light shines through colored glass ornaments and prisms in the Green Room while paper doves in the Red Room carry messages of peace. Doves are also suspended overhead along the Cross Hall, which runs between the East Room and the State Dining Room. </p>

<p>In the State Dining Room, a starburst made out of sugar shines above the massive gingerbread White House, which includes snow-covered South Grounds dotted with dozens of twinkling mini Christmas trees and a scene of people ice skating in a rink on the South Lawn. </p>



<p>The sugary confection — which is for display purposes only and never eaten — was built using 25 sheets of gingerbread dough, 10 sheets of sugar cookie dough, 65 pounds of pastillage, a sugar paste, 45 pounds of chocolate, 50 pounds of royal icing, and 10 pounds of gum paste.</p>



<p>Military families from the USS Delaware and the USS Gabrielle Giffords, two Navy vessels that Jill Biden sponsors, to make paper garlands decorating the State Dining Room, including two large trees there. </p>



<p>As part of Joining Forces, Jill Biden&#8217;s White House initiative to support military families, the first lady allowed National Guard families to be the first to experience the decor. She invited their children — girls in sparkly dresses and shoes and boys sporting bow ties — to join her on the stage as she thanked their parents for serving their country. </p>



<p>The Bidens&#8217; late son, Beau, was a major in the Delaware Army National Guard. He died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46.</p>

<p>Shipping companies usually make their holiday deliveries right on time like Santa Claus.</p>



<p>But not if the gift-giver doesn&#8217;t send the package early enough. And nothing disappoints a kid more on a holiday than a present that&#8217;s still in transit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, as the United States Postal Service says, &#8220;The earlier you send, the better: Don’t delay, mail and ship today!&#8221;</p>



<p>If you can&#8217;t get to a post office or shipping location today, here are a list of domestic holiday send-by dates to ensure holiday cards and gifts are received before Christmas (Dec. 25), Hanukkah (Dec. 25–Jan. 2), and Kwanzaa (Dec. 26–Jan. 1).</p>



<p>Ship prior to these deadlines to avoid stressing over tracking updates on the eve of a holiday.&nbsp;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>This season&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/life/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-2024-rcna177565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockefeller Christmas Tree has arrived in New York City</a>&nbsp;and is just days away from illuminating Manhattan.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Dec. 4, all 50,000 multi-colored LED lights on the massive Norway spruce, which stands 74-feet tall and 43-feet wide, will be lit from Rockefeller Plaza in the annual holiday celebration.</p>



<p>Back for another year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/news/kelly-clarkson-hosting-2024-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting-rcna178646?search=Rockefeller%20tree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelly Clarkson announced she is set to host this year&#8217;s “Christmas in Rockefeller Center”</a>&nbsp;once again, teasing “the best music, star-studded surprises and, of course, the lighting of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/life/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-2024-rcna177565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world-famous Christmas tree</a>&nbsp;that is so special.”</p>



<p>So how can you watch the iconic Rockefeller Center tree lighting? Here&#8217;s what to know, whether you&#8217;re in New York City or anywhere in the country.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How and where to watch the Rockefeller Christmas tree lighting</h2>



<p>For those in New York City hoping to watch the lighting in person, the special event will take place by the tree, situated above the Rink at Rockefeller Center between 49th and 50th Streets, and 5th and 6th Avenues.</p>



<p>Though the area around Rockefeller Center is open to the public, viewers can buy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rockefellercenter.com/buy-tickets/#holiday" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tickets to be&nbsp;photographed</a>&nbsp;with the tree in the background.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rockefellercenter.com/buy-tickets/#holiday" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VIP tickets are also available</a>&nbsp;for a closer spot to the tree.</p>



<p>For those watching from the warmth of their homes, the tree lighting will air as part of the &#8220;Christmas at Rockefeller Center&#8221; two-hour live show on both NBC and Peacock on Dec. 4 at 8 p.m. ET. (Peacock is owned by TODAY.com’s parent company, NBCUniversal.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Which artists are performing at the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting?</h2>



<p>In addition to serving as host alongside TODAY&#8217;s Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, Al Roker and Craig Melvin, Kelly Clarkson is set to hit the stage for a performance.</p>



<p>The festive evening will also include performances from the Backstreet Boys, Jennifer Hudson, the country duo Dan + Shay, Broadway star Megan Hilty, Thalia, known as the Queen of Latin Pop, and more, per a statement from NBC.</p>



<p>And what&#8217;s Rockefeller Center without the Radio City Rockettes? The beloved and impressive dance group is also on tap to give a performance filled with high kicks and plenty of Christmas spirit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When is the Rockefeller Christmas tree lit every day?</h2>



<p>The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree is lit daily from 5 a.m. to midnight.</p>



<p>On Christmas Eve, the tree will be lit for an entire 24 hours, whereas on New Year&#8217;s Eve the spruce will be illuminated from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How long will the Rockefeller Christmas tree be up?</h2>



<p>Rockefeller&#8217;s Christmas Tree will be on display to the public through mid-January 2025. After the tree is taken down, it will be milled into lumber for Habitat for Humanity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What is the significance of the Rockefeller Christmas tree?</h2>



<p>The first Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center went up in December 1931, when the workers at the time decorated a 20-foot high balsam fir with their families, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rockefellercenter.com/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting/#tree-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockefeller Center&#8217;s website</a>.</p>



<p>The first tree lighting occurred in December 1933, and became an annual tradition from that point forward.</p>



<p>In December 1936, two trees went up at Rockefeller Center, which also marks the same year the ice skating rink opened on the Plaza.</p>



<p>Throughout the 1950s and &#8217;60s, the tree became more elaborate and required additional workers to decorate the increasingly larger tree.</p>



<p>In December 1999, the largest tree in Rockefeller Center history graced the Plaza, standing 100 feet tall from Killingworth, Connecticut.</p>



<p>The first 550-pound star elaborately designed with Swarovski crystals donned the top of the tree in 2004, with a three-dimensional, 900-pound Swarovski star set to grace the tree this year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What&#8217;s special about this year&#8217;s tree?</h2>



<p>The 2024 Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, which weighs approximately 11 tons and is about 70 years old, was donated by Earl Albert from West Stockbridge, Massachusetts.</p>



<p>Earl Albert and his late wife, Leslie, planted the tree in 1967. In an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/life/holidays/2024-rockefeller-christmas-tree-origin-story-rcna179306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview in early November</a>, Earl Albert said he wanted their tree to serve as the 2024 Rockefeller Center Christmas tree so he could honor his wife’s memory.</p>



<p>Erik Pauze, the head gardener for Rockefeller Center,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rockefellercenter.com/magazine/arts-culture/who-picks-the-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-every-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in an interview</a>&nbsp;that this year&#8217;s tree has been on his mind for more than four years.</p>



<p>“The process (for this year’s Tree) began in July 2020. I came from getting gas after staying overnight Tree searching. I saw the beautiful Norway Spruce as I drove down the road, and it was right in front of me,” Pauze said in the interview. “I knocked on the door and met Earl Albert. I asked if he would someday consider donating the Tree to Rockefeller Center. His answer was immediately yes.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet the 2024 Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree 🎄 This year’s Tree comes from West Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Weighing about 11 tons and standing 74 feet tall, The Tree will arrive on Saturday, 11/9.

<p>Once the tree was selected, Pauze was sure to keep a close eye on caring for the massive spruce.</p>



<p>“In the spring of this year, I decided to call Earl and ask if I could start feeding it and watering it,” he said. “I came up quite often to feed the Tree, and every time I got out of the car, I smiled and knew it was the right one for Rockefeller Center.”</p>



<p>Following the tree&#8217;s arrival at Rockefeller Plaza on Nov. 9, the Albert family said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/news/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-widower-stroke-rcna180052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nov. 13 statement to TODAY.com</a>&nbsp;that Earl had recently suffered a stroke but was still “looking forward to the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting, and working hard to be able to attend in person.”</p>

<p>Shopping on Temu can feel like playing an arcade game. Instead of using a joystick-controlled claw to grab a toy, visitors to the online marketplace maneuver their computer mouses or cellphone screens to browse colorful gadgets, accessories and trinkets with prices that look too good to refuse. </p>



<p>A pop-up spinning wheel offers the chance to win a coupon. Rotating captions warn that a less than $2 camouflage print balaclava and a $1.23 skeleton hand back scratcher are “Almost sold out.” A flame symbol indicates a $9.69 plush cat print hoodie is selling fast. A timed-down selection of discounted items adds to the sense of urgency. </p>



<p>Welcome to the new online world of impulse buying, a place of guilty pleasures where the selection is vast, every day is Cyber Monday, and an instant dopamine hit that will have faded by the time your package arrives is always just a click away. </p>



<p>By all accounts, we’re living in an accelerating age for consumerism, one that Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, its fierce rival, supercharged with social media savvy and an interminable assortment of cheap goods, most shipped directly from merchants in China based on real-time demand.</p>



<p>The business models of the two platforms, coupled with avalanches of digital or influencer advertising, have enabled them to give Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season. </p>

<p>Software company Salesforce said it expects roughly one in five online purchases in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada to be made through four online marketplaces based or founded in Asia: Shein, Temu, TikTok Shop &#8211; the e-commerce arm of video-sharing platform TikTok &#8211; and AliExpress.</p>



<p>Analysts with Salesforce said they are expected to pull in roughly $160 billion in global sales outside of China. Most of the sales will go to Temu and Shein, a privately held company which is thought to lead the worldwide fast fashion market in revenue.</p>



<p>Lisa Xiaoli Neville, a nonprofit manager who lives in Los Angeles, is sold on Shein. The bedroom of her home is stocked with jeans, shoes, press-on nails and other items from the ultra-fast fashion retailer, all of which she amassed after getting on the platform to purchase a $2 pair of earrings she saw in a Facebook ad.</p>



<p>Neville, 46, estimates she spends at least $75 a month on products from Shein. A $2 eggshell opener, a portable apple peeler and an apple corer &#8211; both costing less than $5 &#8211; are among the quirky, single-use kitchen tools taking up drawer space. She acknowledges she doesn’t need them because she “doesn’t even cook like that.” Plus, she’s allergic to apples.</p>



<p>“I won’t eat apples. It will kill me,” Neville said, laughing. “But I still want the coring thing.” </p>



<p>Shein, now based in Singapore, uses some of the same web design features as Temu’s, such as pop-up coupons and ads, to persuade shoppers to keep clicking, but it appears a bit more restrained in its approach. </p>



<p>Shein primarily targets young women through partnerships with social media influencers. Searching the company&#8217;s name on video platforms turns up creators promoting Shein&#8217;s Black Friday sales event and displaying the dozens of of trendy clothes and accessories they got for comparatively little money. </p>



<p>But the Shein-focused content also includes videos of TikTokers saying they&#8217;re embarrassed to admit they shopped there and critics lashing out at fans for not taking into account the environmental harms or potential labor abuses associated with products that are churned out and shipped worldwide at a speedy pace.</p>



<p>Neville has already picked out holiday gifts for family and friends from the site. Most of the products in her online cart cost under $10, including graphic T-shirts she intends to buy for her son and jeans and loafers for her daughter. All told, she plans to spend about $200 on gifts, significantly less than $500 she used to shell out at other stores in prior years. </p>



<p>“The visuals just make you want to spend more money,” she said, referring to the clothes on Shein&#8217;s site. “They&#8217;re very cheap and everything is just so cute.”</p>



<p>Unlike Shein, Temu&#8217;s appeal cuts across age groups and gender. The platform is the world’s second most-visited online shopping site, software company Similarweb reported in September. Customers go there looking for practical items like doormats and silly products like a whiskey flask shaped like a vintage cellphone from the 1990s. </p>



<p>Temu advertised Black Friday bargains for some items at upwards of 70% off the recommended retail price. Making a purchase can quickly result in receiving dozens of emails offering free giveaways. The caveat: customers have to buy more products. </p>



<p>Ellen Flowers, 36, a lifestyle blogger who lives in Dallas, recently decided to pair a $3,500 dining table with $25 dining chairs from Temu to save money. She&#8217;s also purchased clothes from Temu. The quality or fit wasn&#8217;t always always great, so Flowers donated some unwanted pieces to thrift stores to avoid paying return shipping fees that would cost almost as much as the clothes. </p>



<p>Flowers planned to buy stocking stuffers on Temu as well as baubles for an ornament-swapping party in early December. She also wanted to buy necklaces and bracelets for an activity at her 5-year-old niece&#8217;s upcoming birthday party. </p>



<p>“I love buying my nieces presents,” Flowers says. “Since they’re young, they don’t need the Louis Vuitton handbag. I can give them a cute handbag from Temu. Then they’ll lose interest in a month and I’ll buy them another one.” </p>



<p>Despite their rise, Temu and Shein have proven particularly ripe for pushback. Last year, a coalition of unnamed brands and organizations launched a campaign to oppose Shein in Washington. U.S. lawmakers also have raised the possibility that Temu is allowing goods made with forced labor to enter the country. </p>



<p>More recently, the Biden administration put forward rules that would crack down on a trade rule known as the de minimis exception, which has allowed a lot of cheap products to come into the U.S. duty-free. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to slap high tariffs on goods from China, a move that would likely raise prices and across the retail world. </p>



<p>Both Shein and Temu have set up warehouses in the U.S. to speed up delivery times and help them better compete with Amazon, which is trying to erode their price advantage through a new storefront that also ships products directly from China. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Temu is onboarding Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that would allow the company to not be as exposed to changes around the de minimus trade rule, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse. </p>



<p>The change comes as both Shein and Temu are attempting to expand beyond the bargain-hungry shoppers who popularized their platforms. Temu is allowing sellers to ship products to customers from local U.S. warehouses and says the move will allow it to sell larger items like furniture as it expands its selection of big-ticket items. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, American children&#8217;s clothing retailer The Children’s Place signed a deal last month to distribute its products through Shein’s platform. Last year, Shein went into business with women&#8217;s fashion retailer Forever 21. It has been working to recruit other brands and reportedly has hopes of getting listed on the London Stock Exchange. </p>

<p>Honey, they shrunk the catalogs.</p>



<p>While retailers hope to go big this holiday season, customers may notice that the printed gift guides arriving in their mailboxes are smaller. </p>



<p>Many of the millions of catalogs getting sent to U.S. homes were indeed scaled down to save on postage and paper, resulting in pint-sized editions. Lands’ End, Duluth Trading Company and Hammacher Schlemmer are among gift purveyors using smaller editions. Some retailers are saving even more money with postcards. </p>



<p>Lisa Ayoob, a tech-savvy, online shopper in Portland, Maine, was surprised by the size of a recent catalog she received from outdoor apparel company Carbon2Cobalt. </p>



<p>“It almost felt like it was a pamphlet compared to a catalog,” she said.</p>

<p>Catalogs have undergone a steady recalibration over the years in response to technological changes and consumer behavior. The thick, heavy Sears and J.C. Penney catalogs that brought store displays to American living rooms slimmed down and gave way to targeted mailings once websites could do the same thing. Recent postal rate increases accelerated the latest shift to compact formats.</p>



<p>The number of catalogs mailed each year dropped about 40% between 2006 to 2018, when an estimated 11.5 billion were mailed to homes, according to the trade group formerly known as the American Catalog Mailers Association. In a sign of the times, the group based in Washington rebranded itself in May as the American Commerce Marketing Association, reflecting a broadened focus.</p>



<p>But don&#8217;t expect catalogs to go the way of dinosaurs yet. Defying predictions of doom, they have managed to remain relevant in the e-commerce era. Retail companies found that could treat catalogs with fewer pages as a marketing tool and include QR and promo codes to entice customers to browse online and complete a purchase.</p>



<p>Despite no longer carrying an extended inventory of goods, catalogs are costly to produce and ship. But they hold their own in value because of growing digital advertising costs, helping retailers cut through the noise for consumers barraged by multi-format advertisements, industry officials say. </p>



<p>In an unlikely twist, notable e-commerce companies like Amazon and home goods supplier Wayfair started distributing catalogs in recent years. Amazon began mailing a toy catalog in 2018. That was the same year Sears, which produced an annual Christmas Wish Book Wish starting in 1933, filed for bankruptc y.</p>



<p>Fans of printed information may rejoice to hear that apparel retailer J.Crew relaunched its glossy catalog this year.</p>



<p>Research shows that the hands-on experience of thumbing through a catalog leaves a greater impression on consumers, said Jonathan Zhang, a professor of marketing at Colorado State University. </p>



<p>“The reason why these paper formats are so effective is that our human brains haven’t evolved as fast as technology and computers over the past 10 to 20 years. We retain more information when we read something on paper. That&#8217;s why paper books remain relevant,&#8221; Zhang said. “The psychology shows that three-dimensional, tactile experiences are more memorable.”</p>



<p>Pint-sized presentations still can work, though, because the purpose of catalogs these days is simply to get customers’ attention, Zhang said. Conserving paper also works better with younger consumers who are worried about the holiday shopping season&#8217;s impact on the planet, he said.</p>



<p>Postal increases are hastening changes. The latest round of postage hikes in July included the category with the 8.5-by-11-inch size that used to be ubiquitous for the catalog industry. </p>



<p>Many retailers responded by reducing the size of catalogs, putting them in a lower-cost letter category, said Paul Miller, executive vice president and managing director of the American Commerce Marketing Association. One size, called a “slim jim,” measures 10.5 by 5.5 inches. But there other sizes. Some retailers have further reduced costs by mailing large postcards to consumers.</p>



<p>Lands&#8217; End, for one, is testing new compact formats to supplement its traditional catalogs. This year, that included folded glossy brochures and postcards, along with other formats, Chief Transformation Officer Angie Rieger said. </p>



<p>Maine resident Ayoob said she understands why retailers still use catalogs even though she no longer is a fan of the format. These days, she prefers to browse for products on the internet, not by flipping through paper pages. </p>



<p>“Everybody wants eyeballs. There’s so much out there &#8212; so many websites, so many brands,” said Ayoob, who spent 35 years working in department stores and in the wholesale industry.</p>



<p>Targeting customers at home is not a new concept. L.L. Bean was a pioneer of the mail-order catalog after its founder promoted his famous “Maine Hunting Shoe” to hunting license holders from out-of-state in 1912. The outdoor clothing and equipment company based in Freeport, Maine, is sticking to mailing out regular-sized catalogs for now. </p>



<p>“By showcasing our icons, the catalog became an icon itself,” L.L. Bean spokesperson Amanda Hannah said. &#8220;Even as we invest more in our digital and brand marketing channels, the catalog retains a strong association with our brand, and is therefore an important part of our omni-channel strategy, especially for our loyal customers.” </p>

					<excerpt><![CDATA[While retailers hope to go big this holiday season, customers may notice that the catalogs arriving in their mailboxes are smaller. Many of the millions of catalogs getting sent to U.S. homes were scaled down to save on postage and paper. Some gift purveyors are sending out postcards. In a sign of the times, the American Catalog Mailers Association rebranded itself in May as the American Commerce Marketing Association. Despite no longer carrying an extended inventory of goods, industry experts say catalogs help retailers cut through the noise and still hold their own in value because of growing digital advertising costs.]]></excerpt>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What is Kwanzaa?</h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/initiatives/kwanzaa" target="_blank">Kwanzaa</a> is a non-religious, seven-day-long <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/holidays">holiday</a> that celebrates African and African American history and culture. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When is Kwanzaa?</h2>



<p>Kwanzaa is celebrated between December 26 and January 1 every year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When was Kwanzaa created?</h2>



<p>Kwanzaa was created by activist and author Maulana Ron Karenga in 1966. In establishing the holiday, Karenga hoped to introduce a nationally celebrated holiday that would bring Black Americans together and reaffirm and restore African heritage and culture. The holiday gained popularity in the 1980s and 90s with the rise of the Black Power movement.</p>



<p>Karenga drew on practices and celebrations used in harvest festivals all across Africa. In fact, the word Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase &#8220;matunda ya kwanza,&#8221; which means &#8220;first fruits.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How do you celebrate Kwanzaa?</h2>



<p>During the weeklong celebration, families come together to eat meals of African diaspora-inspired foods, recite the work of famous Black writers and thinkers and lighting one of the candles on the kinara, a seven-branched candelabra holding one black candle, three red candles and three green candles.</p>



<p>The colors, which can also be found in the clothing worn by families and decorations they put out for the holiday, honor the three-striped Pan-African flag. The red of the top stripe represents the historical struggle Black people have faced across the globe, while the bottom green stripe represents a hopeful future. In the middle, the black stripe embodies African American people.</p>



<p>Families also decorate with other symbols inspired by African culture, such as a woven mat called a Mkeka, an ear of corn for each child in the house (Muhindi), fruit to represent the harvest (Mazao) and gifts (Zawadi).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What are the seven principles of Kwanzaa?</h2>



<p>Each day of Kwanzaa, families light a candle on the kinara, a seven-branched candelabra, representing one of the seven principles celebrated during the holiday. Each day is dedicated to one of the following principles or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/seven-principles-kwanzaa" target="_blank">Nguzo Saba</a>: </p>



<ul>
<li>Umoja (Unity)</li>



<li>Kujichagulia (Self-Determination)</li>



<li>Ujima (Collective work and responsibility)</li>



<li>Ujamaa (Cooperative economics)</li>



<li>Nia (Purpose)</li>



<li>Kuumba (Creativity)</li>



<li>Imani (Faith)</li>
</ul>

				<![CDATA[
<p>They&#8217;re up, up and — almost — away.</p>



<p>The massive helium balloons that will float through New York City for&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/how-to-watch-macys-thanksgiving-parade-17ae1bbad2f54973715b39c82b0557a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a>&nbsp;took shape on Wednesday, when they were filled with helium ahead of the big event.</p>



<p>“You see these giant balloons come to life and they’re really, really huge,&#8221; said Stephanie Senkevich, one of dozens of people helping inflate the stars of Thursday&#8217;s show. “You can see them start on the ground right next to you where you look taller than them. And slowly, slowly, they start to raise right above you.”</p>



<p>This year, 17 giant character balloons and other inflatables will travel from Manhattan’s Upper West Side to Macy’s Herald Square flagship store on 34th Street, alongside floats, performers, marching bands and more.</p>



<p>New balloons for 2025 will feature characters including Minnie Mouse, Goku from ”Dragon Ball” and Spider-Man, joining longtime favorites such as Smokey Bear and SpongeBob SquarePants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What are the new balloons?</h2>



<p>There will be six new featured character balloons, including Minnie Mouse, “Extraordinary Noorah” with The Elf on the Shelf, Gabby from “Gabby’s Dollhouse,” Goku from ”Dragon Ball,&#8221; Marshall from &#8220;Paw Patrol&#8221; and a new “Spider-Man.”</p>

<p>“Katie had this idea to get a light-colored tablecloth and have everyone go around and write what they’re thankful for,” Caroline Harrington told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/parents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TODAY.com</a>. “My family has been doing it ever since.”</p>



<p>The Harringtons&#8217; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/parents/why-thanksgiving-tablecloth-great-family-tradition-t105187" target="_blank">gratitude tablecloth</a> is now 19 feet long, and after more than two decades, the linen is dotted with gravy and cranberry sauce from Thanksgivings past. But the retired massage therapist and her husband Denis Harrington, don’t mind one bit.</p>



<p>“It’s just part of the memories,” Harrington explained. “I used to wash it, but then the messages were starting to fade. So I thought, ‘Heck, I’ll just shake it off and we’ll have some stains.’”</p>



<p>Harrington, whose four sons are now grown, considers the tablecloth a piece of their family history. It includes signatures from relatives who are no longer alive, including Harrington&#8217;s father.</p>



<p>“Everybody loves it because it’s just so simple and anyone can do it. All you need is a Sharpie,” Harrington said. For kids who can’t write, Harrington suggests tracing their hands.</p>

<p>“Anyone can be included,” she said. “You’ll go back and laugh at some of the things like we have.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The holiday season really kicks off when the massive helium balloons start floating through New York. The <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/tag/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Macy&#8217;s Thanksgiving Day parade</a> — two years away from its 100th birthday — this year will feature 17 giant character balloons, 22 floats, 15 novelty and heritage inflatables, 11 marching bands, 700 clowns, 10 performance groups and more stars than can fit around a table.</p>



<p>The parade begins on Manhattan’s Upper West Side and ends at Macy’s Herald Square flagship store on 34th Street, which serves as a stage and backdrop for performances.</p>



<p>Here’s key things to know about the parade and how to watch it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What time does the Macy&#8217;s Thanksgiving Day parade start?</h2>



<p>For the second year in a row, Thursday&#8217;s parade starts at 8:30 a.m., in all time zones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What channel is the Macy&#8217;s Thanksgiving Day parade on?</h2>



<p>It will be on NBC, available with an antenna or through cable and satellite providers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How to stream the Macy&#8217;s Thanksgiving Day parade</h2>



<p>For cord cutters, the parade is being simulcast on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.peacocktv.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.peacocktv.com/" target="_blank">Peacock</a> and an encore telecast begins at 2 p.m. ET/PT. A Spanish language simulcast will also be on Telemundo.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What&#8217;s the weather for the Macy&#8217;s Thanksgiving Day parade?</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Who is hosting the Macy&#8217;s Thanksgiving Day parade?</h2>



<p>For those watching on TV or computers, the trio of hosting stalwarts — Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Al Roker from “TODAY.” But this year might be more emotional since it could be Kotb&#8217;s last — her last official day at “TODAY” will be Jan. 10. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What are the new balloons at the Macy&#8217;s Thanksgiving Day parade?</h2>



<p>There will be six new featured character balloons, including Minnie Mouse, “Extraordinary Noorah” with The Elf on the Shelf, Gabby from “Gabby’s Dollhouse,” Goku from ”Dragon Ball,&#8221; Marshall from &#8220;Paw Patrol&#8221; and a new “Spider-Man.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What about new floats?</h2>



<p>New floats include ones from brands like Disney Cruise Line, Haribo, “Wednesday” from Netflix,” Universal Orlando Resorts and “The Grannies Car” from BBC Studios’ “Bluey.” Nickelodeon and Paramount’s “Dora the Explorer” will have both a float and a balloon. One new float will spotlight the Rao’s food brand, featuring a knight and a dragon in battle made with actual pasta elements. Another will celebrate The Bronx Zoo&#8217;s 125th anniversary with representations of a tiger, a giraffe, a zebra and a gorilla.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Is your state represented by any of the bands?</h2>



<p>The marching bands will hail from Massachusetts, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Arkansas, South Dakota, Georgia, South Carolina, West Virginia and, naturally, New York.</p>

<p>Travel can be stressful in the best of times. Now add in the high-level anxiety that seems to be baked into every holiday season, and it&#8217;s clear that travelers could use some help calming frazzled nerves.</p>



<p>Travel pros say there is plenty you can do ahead of time to make for a happier and less-stressful holiday journey.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Make a list and check things off</h2>



<p>A week before you leave, write down things you need to bring and tasks you need to do before the trip.</p>



<p>“This can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,” says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. “The key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Carry your comfort zone with you</h2>



<p>Noise-canceling headphones can go a long way toward blocking out annoyances during travel, although if you use them you should keep an eye on display boards or your phone for any flight or gate changes.</p>



<p>Spotify, YouTube and other sites offer music playlists with names like “Relaxing Chill Out Calming Music for Airports” and “Perfect — Music Travel Relax.&#8221; Or try “Music for Airports,” a groundbreaking album that launched the ambient music genre in 1978.</p>



<p>It’s also good to carry extra medications, a change of clothes, a toothbrush and a phone-charging cable, just in case. </p>



<p>Bringing along some snacks or a sandwich from home can feel comforting and be a great alternative to pricey airport offerings.</p>



<p>“I tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,” Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Stay hydrated </h2>



<p>To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.</p>



<p>Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends “loading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you’re covering your bases inside and out.” </p>



<p>And don’t forget your hair.</p>



<p>“Just as the low humidity on the airplane is dehydrating for your skin, it can also dry out your hair. If possible, use a deep conditioner before your trip,” Gould says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Get app-y and know the rules</h2>



<p>“Every airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process, paying for perks in advance, or seat upgrades,” Feldman says. “It’s best to understand all of the above before getting to the airport so that you are not taken off guard.”</p>



<p>Having the airline&#8217;s app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Give yourself the gift of extra time</h2>



<p>Security lines can be much longer — and slower — than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.</p>



<p>If you’re too early, you can always explore the airport shops and lounges or settle in with a good book somewhere.</p>



<p>“I always confirm whether or not there is a lounge I have access to in my departing gate ahead of time,” Feldman says. But even without lounge access, she says, &#8220;I like to know what the restaurants and waiting areas (near) the gate are like.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Try to identify the source of your anxiety</h2>



<p>“If you have a sense of why you are feeling stressed, it can help to figure out ways to reduce that stress,&#8221; says Lynn F. Bufka, head of practice for the American Psychological Association. &#8220;So if you’re feeling overwhelmed, are there things that you can outsource? Is there someone in your family who can help with parts of the planning?”</p>



<p>Recognize that crowds, bad weather and canceled flights are beyond your control.</p>



<p>And some people just don&#8217;t like to travel far or to fly. </p>



<p>“If it’s fear, like fear of flying, it’s important to know that it can be treated, and that treatment can really improve the quality of your life,” Bufka says. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Prepare to welcome yourself home</h2>



<p>A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.</p>



<p>“Always, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,” Feldman says.</p>



<p>Wash the sheets, take out the trash, put away clothes, clean the countertops. “Arriving home to a neat and tidy space is the best homecoming, especially after a long time away,” she says.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Thanksgiving is upon us, and many people are gearing up for the turkey feast with all the fixings. A popular strategy for eating as much food as possible is to fast all day in preparation for the big festivities and start the meal with an empty belly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, is skipping meals before the big holiday dinner recommended?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dietitians say this Thanksgiving eating plan sets you up for failure, but the reason has nothing to do with calories or eating healthy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learn why dietitians say you shouldn’t skip meals leading into the Thanksgiving feast and when and what to eat beforehand.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Why you shouldn&#8217;t skip pre-Thanksgiving meals</h2>



<p>Even though I’m a dietitian who promotes healthy eating daily, I think you should eat whatever the heck you want on Thanksgiving Day.</p>



<p>Food supplies nourishment and calories, but it also provides joy and comfort. If you look forward to eating foods like sweet potato casserole, turkey with gravy and cranberry sauce, then dig in! One day of indulgent eating won’t make or break your health.&nbsp;<a href="https://enjoyfoodenjoylife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Rodriguez</a>, a New York-based registered dietitian adds, “Thanksgiving is about so much more than food, it’s also about family, friends, appreciation, great conversation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanksgiving is a day you should thoroughly savor from start to finish. However, depriving yourself of food until the turkey dinner may interfere with your enjoyment of the day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Skipping meals causes extreme hunger, which is not only distracting but leads to overeating and eating too quickly. Overeating causes you to feel terrible after the big meal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In fact, your body will appreciate being fed at regular times, setting you up for success as you enter the eating occasions later in the day,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://shawsimpleswaps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Shaw</a>, registered dietitian and author of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Dummies-Wendy-Peterson/dp/1119641403/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;keywords=instant+pot+COOKBOOK+FOR+DUMMIES&amp;qid=1585258212&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzQkoxN1lCSFEwNUNKJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODMxOTI3MUo0SUdMMzM1SVFCNSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNjEyNDE2MVFNS1JXWEY4OUlXOSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU%3D&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=simpleswaps0a-20&amp;linkId=68380a37321783e77ca09105965a54cf&amp;language=en_US&amp;asc_campaign=&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.today.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiet-fitness%2Feating-before-thanksgiving-dinner-rcna181332&amp;asc_source=direct_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instant Pot Cookbook for Dummies</a>.”</p>



<p>And if you have a drink or two while preparing the Thanksgiving bird, make sure you eat some food to help metabolize the alcohol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of fasting all day in preparation for the Thanksgiving meal, use these dietitian-approved tips that will allow you to eat what you want and still feel good after the meal.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When and how much should you eat before the Thanksgiving meal?</h2>



<p>Everyone eats turkey and all the fixings at different times of the day, so it’s important to consider that when planning your meals. If you’re eating in the early afternoon, Rodriguez suggests a breakfast that hits the “power triangle” of protein, fiber and heart-healthy fat a few hours before. If your family sits down for a turkey dinner, have a well-balanced breakfast in the morning and lunch two to four hours before.</p>



<p>Shaw notes, “Eating balanced meals or snacks that include a protein and fiber source may help prevent mindlessly grazing on appetizers before the feast hits the table.&#8221; Plus, you may feel less inclined to eat those dishes that don’t really wow you, Shaw says.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What should you eat before your Thanksgiving meal?</h2>



<p>The pre-Thanksgiving meal doesn’t need to be complicated. Rodriguez suggests oatmeal, overnight oats, smoothies, avocado toast or a veggie omelet for breakfast. These options are packed with fiber and protein to keep you full.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For lunch, opt for something simple, like cottage cheese on multi-grain toast, a whole wheat wrap with chopped veggies, chickpeas and some dressing, a cup of lentil soup or a turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread with lettuce and tomato.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">The bottom line</h2>



<p>Eat what you want on Thanksgiving. There’s no need to deprive yourself of pumpkin or apple pie. Savor these dishes that come around only once a year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But don&#8217;t enter the meal with a bottomless pit in your stomach. Eating a pre-feast breakfast or lunch can help you enjoy the foods you love without ending up with a stomach ache.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though temperatures have already started to drop in some parts of the country, winter doesn&#8217;t officially begin until mid-December.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what to know about the winter solstice, the astronomical start to the snowy season and the shortest day of the year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What is the winter solstice?</h2>



<p>The winter solstice marks the beginning of astronomical winter. It&#8217;s different from the beginning of the meteorological winter, which is based on our 12-month calendar.</p>



<p>To answer this question more completely, let&#8217;s go back to middle school science class for a minute. The Earth rotates in two primary ways: first, it moves in a big circle around the sun; second, it spins around an axis like a top, creating day and night. That axis is tilted on a slight angle, causing the Northern and Southern hemispheres to receive different amounts of sunlight at different times of the year.</p>



<p>So, though we tend to think about the winter solstice as a day-long event, the term actually refers to a precise moment at which one half of the Earth — either the top or the bottom — is tilted the furthest away from the sun, meaning that that half of the planet sees the fewest hours of sunlight it will see all year. </p>



<p>Though the winter solstice marks the shortest day of each year, it also signals an increase in the amount of sunlight each day for the next six months. </p>



<p>Similarly, the day when the Earth&#8217;s tilt is closest to the sun is called the summer solstice. It&#8217;s the longest day of the year and marks the astronomical beginning of summer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When is the winter solstice?</h2>



<p>In the Northern Hemisphere, the winter solstice occurs every year on Dec. 21 or 22. This year, it falls on Dec. 21.</p>



<p>The summer solstice is six months later around June 21.</p>



<p>For people who live below the equator, however, those days are flipped. Their winter solstice occurs in June, while their summer solstice happens in December.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What&#8217;s an equinox?</h2>



<p>Each year, there are two equinoxes — one in the spring, and one in the fall.</p>



<p>During the equinoxes, the sun is directly above the Earth&#8217;s equator, meaning there are equal amounts of sunlight and darkness on those two days. </p>



<p>The vernal equinox, which happens in March in the Northern Hemisphere, marks the astrological end of winter. In September, the autumnal equinox signals the astrological end of summer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When are the next astrological season changes?</h2>



<p>Below is a list of the astronomical season changes we can expect to see following the upcoming winter solstice next month:</p>

<li>Vernal Equinox (Spring): Thursday, March 20, 2025, 5:01 a.m.</li>



<li>Summer Solstice (Summer): Friday, June 20, 2025, 10:42 p.m.</li>



<li>Autumnal Equinox (Fall): Monday, September 22, 2025, 2:19 p.m.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Can you see the winter solstice?</h2>



<p>Sort of. Each day, the sun traces a path across the sky, rising in the east and setting in the west. As the winter solstice approaches and the number of hours of sunlight in a day decreases, the sun&#8217;s path sinks lower in the sky, though it follows the same general arc. </p>



<p>By the time the winter solstice arrives, the sun sits at the lowest position in the sky it can.</p>



<p>As a result, the shadow you cast becomes longer and longer as the winter solstice approaches. So, while solstices aren&#8217;t nearly as visible as eclipses, if you go outside at noon on the winter solstice, your shadow will be the longest it will be all year.</p>
