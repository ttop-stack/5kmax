				<![CDATA[
<p>The holidays always bring a bevy of beverages for seasonal sipping. In recent years, we’ve tried the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/recipes/gingerbread-martini-recipe-t274798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gingerbread Martini</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/recipes/rudolph-cocktail-recipe-t120299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rudolph</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/food/drinks/snow-globe-cocktail-rcna128790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snowglobe</a>. This year, apparently, we’re making hot Dr Pepper.</p>



<p>Yes, it’s the same old soda standby you know and love, but with a literal twist! To make this trending tipple, you just heat Dr Pepper, add a slice of lemon and serve. You can warm it up in a mug once the carbonation dies down, or just Crock-Pot a whole 2-liter for a crowd.</p>







<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://drpeppermuseum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr Pepper Museum</a>&nbsp;serves it every winter, but it’s not the only one: Hudson Valley’s massive&nbsp; and legendary antiques store&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJKotvXHd_1/?igsh=MTFvcGxrN3AyaHZ5NA==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Newbergh Vintage Emporium</a>&nbsp;is using it to add that nostalgic holiday touch, because as popular as it is at the moment, it’s actually nothing new.</p>



<p>Dr Pepper first promoted the recipe in the 1960s to bump lagging sales in winter, as in this classic Dick Clark TV spot:</p>







<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJKotvXHd_1/?igsh=MTFvcGxrN3AyaHZ5NA==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some versions</a>&nbsp;even suggested spiking it with rum and calling it a “Boomer.”</p>



<p>Although not many people have remembered it until now, it was something of a staple at gameday concession stands and teens’ parties in the ‘60s and ‘70s (sans rum), at least in some parts of the country.</p>



<p>If you dig around in newspaper archives, you’ll see most mentions center in Texas, and that’s no coincidence: Dr Pepper was invented in Waco in 1885, making it the oldest soda in the United States.</p>



<p>According to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://drpeppermuseum.com/history/" target="_blank">brand lore</a>, a young pharmacist at Morrison’s Old Corner Drug Store was aiming to make a beverage that tasted the way the air around the flavored syrups counter smelled — and Dr Pepper was born.</p>







<p>That spicy-fruity background of indistinguishably commingled aromas is allegedly what makes Dr Pepper work as a hot drink. The recipe is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drpepper.ca/en/blend-of-23-flavours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hilariously closely-guarded secret</a>, of course, but the company is willing to disclose that there are 23 flavors that go into the final product, and it is rumored to include things like cherry, apricot, almond, licorice and anise. The only thing I can say for sure? It doesn’t have prunes in it. That persistent rumor has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/belle-pepper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thoroughly debunked</a>.</p>



<p>Now that I feel reassured that there’s no prune juice in it, I’m ready for a taste test! Since I am a late-20th-century native Texan, I actually had this a few times growing up and remember it fondly. Still, sometimes the fog of yesteryear clouds the truth and I feel a rising dread. Is this beverage up-and-coming or a has-been?</p>



<p>I prefer sodas made with cane sugar and I’m betting, for this drink, that’s doubly important. Real sugar has a more complex flavor and crisper finish than corn syrup and heating can bring out the less desirable mouthfeel and flavor of the latter.</p>



<p>I poured it into a microwave-safe mug, stirred to banish most of the bubbles and heated for 1 minute. It smells uncannily familiar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-20-at-12.25.40%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hot Dr Pepper may look like black coffee but it smells like hot Dr Pepper. (Courtesy Heather Martin)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Warming happily brings the purported spice flavors to the forefront but I found the first sip too sweet. (Carbonation isn’t just bubbles; it reacts to form carbonic acid and adds a tartness that you’ll find lacking when it goes flat.) I rubbed the peel on the mug lip and added a giant squeeze of lemon with a tiny smidge of sea salt, maybe 10 fine grains, to smooth out the sweetness. With those tweaks, it’s solidly in drinkable territory, at least for old times’ sake.</p>



<p>If you’re a devotee of the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/food/trends/coffee-mate-dr-pepper-dirty-soda-creamer-rcna142245" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dirty soda fad</a>, you may be tempted to add a little drizzle of half-and-half, but I wouldn’t risk it. With that extra lemony acidity, the resulting curds and whey will have you wondering if there’s a doctor in the house.</p>



<p>On that suspect dairy note, it turns out Dr Pepper is having a banner year with a second trending holiday drink, Dr Pepper and eggnog, or “Pepp Nog,” if you will.</p>







<p>There’s no set recipe on social media, but there is at least one in published form, in the “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/zzbf3m/dr_pepper_egg_nog_1980/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Garvin County Extension Homemakers Recipe Book 1980</a>.” That one has a lot more eggnog than Dr Pepper, but the ones trending online have the opposite ratio. Let’s try both!</p>



<p>I agree with most of the taste testers on social media about the mostly Dr Pepper version;&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/overthetoppopshop/reel/DDazp7eSw8i/" target="_blank">it’s not good</a>. It didn’t curdle at least, but it’s something like&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.yoo-hoo.com/" target="_blank">Yoo-hoo</a>&nbsp;gone very wrong, simultaneously too watery and too sweet. There’s a strange, sour aftertaste, perhaps the nutmeg clashing with the cola flavor. It also makes a scummy-looking foam until it calms down a bit. Bah humbug!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-20-at-12.25.25%E2%80%AFPM.png?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A glass of 20% Dr Pepper and 80% eggnog. (Courtesy Heather Martin)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The other way around, roughly 80% eggnog and 20% Dr Pepper, is a lot better. Don’t get me wrong — it’s still weird — but it doesn’t foam so alarmingly, and the flavors are more harmonious. I actually added extra nutmeg. I think it’s best very cold, and after I let it sit with a few ice cubes and dilute slightly, it wasn’t so (cringe) viscous.</p>



<p>Of the three, I think the last is best. It has classic holiday flavors, some retro appeal&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;a little modern pizazz.</p>



<p>If you don’t do milk? Dr Pepper has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drpepperrecipes.com/non-alcoholic-beverages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recipes for beverages</a>&nbsp;online including oat milk as an ingredient, so if you don’t want to find out the hard way which plant milks curdle, maybe opt for one of the oat nogs on the market.</p>



<p>If you don’t do eggnog? In that case, I’m not sure I can help you. Maybe you should shake up a big green glass of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/recipes/grinch-cocktail-recipe-t120298" target="_blank">Grinch</a>!</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Only recently given stewardship over his late father’s work, Sean Ono Lennon is on a remarkable run.</p>



<p>The only child of John Lennon and Yoko Ono won an Academy Award this year for a short film based on his parents’ 1971 song “Happy Christmas (War is Over”)” and, a few months later, was nominated for his first-ever Grammy, for producing a box set on the album “Mind Games,” originally released in 1973.</p>



<p>“It feels overwhelming and surreal,” said Lennon, who also recently shared a Webby Award with his mother for Ono’s interactive art project “Wish Tree.”</p>



<p>For Lennon, who was 5 when the former Beatle was&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/john-hinckley-entertainment-new-york-city-yoko-ono-f1752d55a0229a5a430f429d376542d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">murdered</a>&nbsp;in 1980, the work is a way to connect with his father. It’s more than a preservation mission: On “Mind Games,” he takes artistic license, pulling apart the recordings of John Lennon’s music to create something entirely new.</p>



<p>Lennon was inspired, in part, by another Beatle offspring, Dhani Harrison, who helped repackage his own father’s “All Things Must Pass.” Dhani Harrison is also behind this fall’s reissue of his dad’s “Living in the Material World,” but that experience is nothing like what Lennon did with “Mind Games.”</p>



<p>Besides the music,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHhSVU8Znr8" target="_blank">the innovative box</a>&nbsp;is modeled after one of his mother’s art pieces and filled with art reproductions, hidden music, video, messages and puzzles, some only visible through an ultraviolet light that is included — “mind games,” remember? The deluxe box retails for $1,350, but there are less expensive options.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning what his father meant to others by hearings fans sing through the window</h2>



<p>Lennon, 49, knew his father was a musician before he died; the boy tagged along to the studio for some “Double Fantasy” sessions. But truly understanding his impact came later, like when he’d hear fans singing his father’s music outside their New York apartment on the Oct. 9 birthday they shared. “It was pretty clear to me that wasn’t happening with my friends,” he said.</p>



<p>His father’s music played constantly around the house, and learning to play those songs launched his own journey to become a musician.</p>



<p>“I think I would have rebelled more against my dad’s — and my mom’s — music if I had grown up with my dad in the house and I had been angry at him or rebelled against him,” he told The Associated Press. “Because he wasn’t around, I’ve always really cherished the music as sort of a living part of him.”</p>



<p>He inherited the job of keeping his father’s music alive for new generations when his mom, now 91, retired.</p>



<p>In liner notes for “Mind Games,” Lennon explains that “the only meaningful way that I can show my love to him” is to work hard on his music and keep it in the culture’s consciousness. That’s poignant, and maybe a little sad. Does Lennon really have to prove to anyone that he loves his father?</p>



<p>“What else can I do in this Earth to express my love and reverence for my father than to do an incredibly meticulous job of taking care of his music?” he said. “I can’t actually think of anything else, other than taking care of my mother, which I try to do as well.”</p>



<p>That reverence for his elders came from his mother, he believes. When his Japanese grandparents came over to the U.S. “it was like the president was visiting,” he recalled.</p>



<p>Only after he began the “Mind Games” project did Lennon learn that the album wasn’t particularly well-regarded when it was released. He found an interview where even John Lennon considered it a transition from a period of political activism to being a musician again. The title song was its only hit.</p>



<p>That attitude lingers, judging by an online site called “Brutally Honest Rock Album Reviews.” In an&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brutallyhonestrockalbumreviews.wordpress.com/2024/07/16/album-review-john-lennon-mind-games-the-ultimate-cash-grab/" target="_blank">unsigned review</a>, the author said the “Mind Games” reissue defines overkill. “You can now own and forever cherish six different versions of songs that were unmemorable at best and a complete waste of time at worst.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Motivated to make people take a second look at “Mind Games”</h2>



<p>That only motivated Lennon to work harder, and led to a bold artistic decision. Part of the reason the album didn’t really connect was because it wasn’t promoted well or supported by concerts, he said. But he also described the original album mix as thin and not doing justice to the music.</p>



<p>Using the original recordings, he constructed new versions of the songs, sometimes emphasizing different instruments. He sought a warmer, more direct sound reminiscent of Lennon’s “Plastic Ono Band” album — most visibly on “Aisumasen (I’m Sorry),” one of a handful of compositions reflecting marital turmoil that presaged Lennon’s notorious “lost weekend” separation from Ono.</p>



<p>Different versions of the title cut also show Sean’s approach. There’s the original “Mind Games,” with a distinctive chiming sound that drives the melody. That’s stripped away in a new mix where a reggae guitar lick becomes audible. An organ-dominated instrumental sounds like a church hymn. There are other outtakes, some with alternate lyrics and one with a snippet of “Make Love, Not War,” a song fragment dating back to the Beatles that the author repurposed.</p>



<p>He didn’t have a trove of unheard material to mine, other than Lennon’s demo of “I’m the Greatest,” a song he gave to Beatle mate Ringo Starr.</p>



<p>In some of the new versions, Sean goes beyond remixing or revealing outtakes to imposing his own artistic vision over his father’s.</p>



<p>“There are some people who feel that it’s taking liberties, and I guess it technically is,” Lennon said. “The way I look at it is, if I’m going to do the best job I can, the only way I can do that is to follow my heart and make it sound the best that it can sound. If that means maybe turning down an instrument a lot in a certain section because I don’t think it’s helping, then I’m going to do that.”</p>



<p>For anyone who wants the original versions, they’re readily available.</p>



<p>“It’s very forensic work,” he said. “I’m not worried about what someone else is going to think. I’m just in there trying to do good by my dad, and I really feel that I know how to do good by him, because I know his music better than I know anybody else’s music.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">His father’s human moments that inspired his son as a musician</h2>



<p>As a musician, he relates to moments where his father expresses vulnerability, like an interview where John described “Intuition” as a good song where he didn’t nail the lyrics. The&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-arts-and-entertainment-peter-jackson-e81542a42c74446ad837075140777d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Get Back” film</a>&nbsp;of recording sessions for the “Let it Be” album showed the Beatles as humans who didn’t hand songs down from Mount Olympus.</p>



<p>Next on the docket is a film resurrection of the “One to One” concerts involving his father and a reissue of the “Walls and Bridges” album. Sean, who lives and works in New York and is involved in a longtime relationship with musician and model Kemp Muhl, released his own album,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm0-N23QjeQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Asterisms,”</a>&nbsp;this year.</p>



<p>Told he sounded like his father when singing forcefully, Lennon practically whispered lyrics on his early albums. He hated the way he sounded, but didn’t want to deal with the comparisons. He doesn’t hold back anymore. “Now I’m too old to care,” he said.</p>



<p>“I didn’t get into music because I had some great talent or something,” he said. “I got into it because my dad was this famous musician and playing his songs and learning his music made me feel closer to him.”</p>

<p><strong><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411385/chris-martin-reveals-why-he-loves-calling-son-moses-my-partner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online</a></em></strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/chris_martin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Martin</a> is sharing rare insight into his parenting.</p>



<p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/coldplay" target="_blank">Coldplay</a> singer recalled a stunt he likes to pull when he&#8217;s out with son Moses Martin, 18, who he shares with ex-wife <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/gwyneth_paltrow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>&#8216;s children.</p>



<p>&#8220;My favorite new thing to embarrass my son is,&#8221; he told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/coldplay-chris-martin-music-of-the-spheres-tour-future-1235204333/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> in an interview published Dec. 19, &#8220;if we&#8217;re walking down the street and someone comes up to us and they say, &#8216;I’m sorry to disturb you while you’re with your son,&#8217; I say, &#8216;That&#8217;s not my son. That&#8217;s my partner.'&#8221;</p>



<p>In reality, Martin has been romantically linked to Dakota Johnson for more than seven years. The two have sparked <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1406204/did-dakota-johnson-and-chris-martin-break-up-heres-the-truth-about-their-engagement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight:400">breakup rumors</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> over the past year and while the rocker did not address them, he said in the interview that the two had recently listened to Kacey Musgraves’ &#8220;Golden Hour&#8221; together and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411369/chris-martin-confirms-dakota-johnson-relationship-status" target="_blank">dubbed t<span style="font-weight:400">he Fifty Shades of Grey actress </span>one of his best friends</a>.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;It is important to say that [romantic love] is such a big factor in everything, even though it feels right to keep it precious and private,&#8221; the 47-year-old said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not denying its power.&#8221;</span></p>



<p>Meanwhile, he has also been spending time with his family. He recently joined Moses and Paltrow — who &#8220;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/525146/gwyneth-paltrow-clarifies-conscious-uncoupling-via-dr-habib-sadeghi-and-dr-sherry-sami" target="_blank">consciously uncoupled</a>&#8221; in 2014 — to support daughter Apple Martin, 20, as she made her official public debut at <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411252/apple-martin-cheekily-addresses-mean-girl-rumors-after-debutante-ball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Le Bal des Débutantes</a> in Paris Dec. 1.</p>



<p>However, Martin confessed the debutante ball was &#8220;so not something&#8221; he ever thought he would do.</p>



<p>&#8220;But because I’m so in love with her,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;OK.'&#8221;</p>



<p>Both kids no longer live with their parents — Apple attends Vanderbilt University in Nashville, while Moses moved out earlier this year and is a freshman at Brown University in Providence, R.I.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sad,&#8221; Martin said about being an empty nester. &#8220;That’s the only word. But of course it’d be weirder if they were still like, &#8216;I can’t leave.&#8217; Then you’d be more worried.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a bird, it&#8217;s a plane, no — it&#8217;s Krypto the Superdog,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/supermans-first-appearance-sells-6-million-becoming-worlds-valuable-co-rcna146718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Man of Steel&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;right-hand canine, making an appearance in the upcoming &#8220;Superman&#8221; movie&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhUht6vAsMY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teaser trailer</a>&nbsp;on Thursday.</p>



<p>This<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/superman-trailer-unveils-james-gunn-superhero-epic-krypto-superdog-rcna184895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> release of the teaser </a>gives fans their first full look at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/new-superman-fully-revealed-photo-director-james-gunn-upcoming-movie-rcna150896" target="_blank">David Corenswet as Superman</a>, as well as the love of his life, Lois Lane (played by Rachel Brosnahan) and his archenemy, Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), in the James Gunn reboot of the DC superhero cinematic universe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The classic hero is at his lowest when the trailer begins, seemingly stranded in frozen terrain after a forceful crash landing and spitting blood from his mouth. Then he whistles for his loyal sidekick, who appears in a thunderous cloud of snow.</p>







<p>&#8220;Take me home,&#8221; he tells Krypto later in the trailer, who takes Superman&#8217;s famous red cape in his mouth and pulls him through the snowy landscape.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s only one other line of dialogue in the entire trailer: a young boy holding a homemade Superman flag while whispering the hero&#8217;s name.</p>



<p>A rendition of John Williams&#8217; classic Superman theme serves as the trailer&#8217;s soundtrack, underlining the teaser&#8217;s theme of hopeful nostalgia.</p>



<p>The trailer also revealed a host of other characters, including Nathan Fillion’s Guy Gardner, Isabela Merced’s Hawkgirl and Edi Gathegi’s Mr. Terrific.</p>



<p>But the chatter on social media indicates Krypto is the character many fans are most excited to see take the screen (and the skies).</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m deadass when I say this but Krypto the Dog is the only reason I’m watching the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Superman?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Superman</a> movie.. <a href="https://t.co/P40t2haRIK">pic.twitter.com/P40t2haRIK</a></p>&mdash; Zero (@zerowontmiss) <a href="https://twitter.com/zerowontmiss/status/1869748686718382445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>



<p>&#8220;I’m deadass when I say this but Krypto the Dog is the only reason I’m watching the #Superman movie,&#8221; one person said&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/zerowontmiss/status/1869748686718382445" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on X</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m sorry but I’m pivoting to Krypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m all about NFTs now: nice fluffy terriers,&#8221; a fan wrote&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryannorth.ca/post/3ldo2uqdmo22f" target="_blank">on BlueSky</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;We must protect Krypto at all costs,&#8221; another&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/almannarino/status/1869775693141467247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warned on X</a>.</p>



<p>One Krypto fan went even farther&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/popetheking/status/1869810872581005430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on X</a>: &#8220;If ANYTHING happens to Krypto I will be going John Wick on anyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>While most other aspects of the trailer stayed loyal to the comics, Gunn seems to have strayed a bit on Krypto&#8217;s casting, opting to portray the dog as more scruffy andthan the polished comic version.</p>



<p>In October, the writer-director revealed that his idea of Krypto was inspired by his own dog, Ozu, who he said came from a hoarding situation in a backyard with 60 other dogs and never knew humans.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Krypto arrives on screens in Superman this summer. Krypto was inspired by our dog Ozu, who we adopted shortly after I started writing Superman. Ozu, who came from a hoarding situation in a backyard with 60 other dogs &amp; never knew human beings, was problematic to say the least. He… <a href="https://t.co/zw8rVqv0n0">pic.twitter.com/zw8rVqv0n0</a></p>&mdash; James Gunn (@JamesGunn) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1846220011356000665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>



<p>&#8220;He immediately came in &amp; destroyed our home, our shoes, our furniture — he even ate my laptop. It took a long time before he would even let us touch him,&#8221; Gunn said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1846220011356000665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>. &#8220;I remember thinking, &#8216;Gosh, how difficult would life be if Ozu had superpowers?&#8217; — and thus Krypto came into the script &amp; changed the shape of the story as Ozu was changing my life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gunn is no stranger to spotlighting computer generated animals and creatures in his films, as demonstrated by the success of Rocket Raccoon and Groot in his &#8220;Guardians of the Galaxy&#8221; films for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>



<p>While there&#8217;s no way to know if Krypto will bring the same success to Superman&#8217;s premiere on July 11, as a fan put it&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/joerussotweets/status/1869763198104293665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on X</a>, one thing is for sure.</p>



<p>&#8220;So many dogs about to be named Krypto, oh my god.&#8221;</p>

<p>Who works harder than&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/hub/questlove" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Questlove?</a>&nbsp;The Academy Award winner has teamed up with Emmy winner Oz Rodriguez and NBC for a new film, “Ladies &amp; Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music,” celebrating&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/saturday-night-live-snl-original-cast-7e6475d12a0be575c1f9825fc276a6a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 years of the program</a>&nbsp;and spotlighting its memorable live music performances.</p>



<p>The three-hour special will feature sketches, performances and over 50 interview subjects, including&nbsp;Bad Bunny,&nbsp;Miley Cyrus,&nbsp;Billie Eilish,&nbsp;Mick Jagger, Dua Lipa, Darryl DMC McDaniels, Tom Morello, Kacey Musgraves, Olivia Rodrigo, Paul Simon,&nbsp;Chris Stapleton&nbsp;and Justin Timberlake.</p>



<p>“Everyone knows the most famous ‘SNL’ appearances, whether it’s Elvis Costello, Prince or the Beastie Boys, but they’re the tip of a huge iceberg,” Questlove wrote in a statement. “The process of going back through the incredible archival footage was like being in a time machine, DeLorean or other. I’m so happy I went on the trip and now get to share it with everyone.”</p>



<p>Last week it was announced that Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson&#8217;s latest documentary, “SLY LIVES! (aka The Burden of Black Genius),” which examines the legacy of Sly &amp; The Family Stone, will be featured at next year’s&nbsp;Sundance Film Festival.</p>



<p>His directorial debut,&nbsp;“Summer of Soul,&#8221;&nbsp;a documentary spotlighting the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, earned him an Oscar. The leader of The Roots who appears on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” also published in 2024 the book &#8220;Hip-Hop Is History.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Ladies &amp; Gentlemen … 50 Years of SNL Music,” will broadcast live on NBC Jan. 27 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. It will become available to stream on Peacock the next day.</p>

<p><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411383/phil-collins-gives-rare-health-update-on-losing-ability-to-play-drums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online</a></em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/phil_collins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phil Collins</a> is speaking out about his health.</p>



<p>The “In the Air Tonight” singer got candid about the long-term effects of his decades of drumming, which eventually left him unable to play the percussion instrument.</p>



<p>“It’s still kind of sinking in a bit,” Collins said in the documentary &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/WdGmydR715Q?si=2kFNBpH2Uy_kVMwP" target="_blank">Phil Collins: Drummer First</a>,&#8221; which was filmed in October 2022 and released Dec. 18. “I’ve spent all my life playing drums. To suddenly not be able to do that is a shock.”</p>



<p>The former Genesis frontman explained that the physical toll of drumming for so many years had impacted his hands and legs, which led him to formally retire from drumming in 2022.</p>



<p>“If I can’t do what I did as well as I did it, I’d rather relax and not do anything,” he continued. &#8220;If I wake up one day and I can hold a pair of drumsticks, then I’ll have a crack at it. But I just feel like I’ve used up my air miles.”</p>



<p><b>READ</b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1410842/michael-jacksons-daughter-paris-jackson-announces-engagement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Michael Jackson&#8217;s Daughter Paris Jackson Engaged to Bandmate Justin Long</a></p>



<p>Before calling it quits, the 73-year-old — who won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 2000 for “You’ll Be in My Heart” from the movie &#8220;Tarzan&#8221; — reunited with Genesis for their Last Domino tour, where his son Nic Collins played the drums on his behalf. His daughter, &#8220;Emily in Paris&#8221; star <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/lily_collins" target="_blank">Lily Collins</a>, paid tribute to the music icon on social media after attending the band’s final concert in London.</p>



<p>“To have witnessed this last show was truly the memory of a lifetime and an event I shall hold in my heart forever,” she wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilyjcollins/p/CblnWBZLQSJ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> at the time. “Endlessly grateful doesn’t begin to do it justice.”</p>







<p>And she went on to shout out her father and brother for their strong finish.</p>



<p>“Thank you dad for being such an inspiration,” she added, “and thank you @nic_collins for making me the proudest sister there is.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>‘Tis the season for spirited and winless debates about what the best&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/hub/christmas">Christmas</a>&nbsp;movie is. No one needs us to remind you about the obvious holiday movies playing on repeat on cable, whether it&#8217;s &#8220;It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life&#8221;, “Home Alone&#8221; or “Love, Actually,&#8221; or even those holiday adjacent classics like “Eyes Wide Shut” and “The Godfather.” But perhaps you are looking to go beyond the obvious this year (sorry, “Christmas Story,&#8221; “White Christmas” etc, etc).</p>



<p>Associated Press Film Writers&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/author/jake-coyle">Jake Coyle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/author/lindsey-bahr">Lindsey Bahr</a>&nbsp;have you covered with the best Christmas films for every mood.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A movie that feels like a Christmas movie but isn’t, really</h2>



<p>“Grand Budapest Hotel”: Truthfully, there’s nothing outside of a little snow to make Wes Anderson’s 2014 delight a Christmas movie. But I don’t think there’s another movie that better resembles the experience of opening a present than “Grand Budapest Hotel.” Unwrap Anderson’s intricate designs and the movie’s Russian doll-like narratives, and smile. (Available for digital rental) — Coyle</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best movie for feeling fancy</h2>



<p>“Metropolitan” (1990): Who among us hasn’t dreamt of doing debutante season in New York? Maybe don’t answer that, but Whit Stillman’s “Metropolitan,” about a few privileged youths on the Upper East Side, is the ideal film to turn on when you’re craving something that feels like an elegant evening on the town but doesn&#8217;t require breaking out the white tie and ball gowns. (Streaming on Criterion, MAX, Hulu and Prime Video) —Bahr</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best performance next to felt</h2>



<p>“A Muppets Christmas Carol” (1992): It’s one thing to do Dickens with, you know, other humans. But Michael Caine gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Ebenezer Scrooge while sharing the screen with the likes of Beaker and Dr. Bunsen Honeydew. To be fair, though, Gonzo the Great and Rizzo the Rat are also really good in this. (Streaming on Disney+) — Coyle</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Christmas cry</h2>



<p>“The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” (1964): Jacques Demy’s technicolor musical isn’t exclusively set at Christmas, but its final tearjerker scene at that snowy gas station is enough for me. The whole candy-colored experience, from Catherine Deneuve’s whimsical bows to Michel Legrand’s sweeping, melancholy score just feels right around the holidays. (Streaming on The Criterion Channel) —Bahr</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The best L.A. Christmas movie</h2>



<p>“Kiss Kiss Bang Bang”: Yuletide traditions don’t normally include a motormouth Robert Downey Jr., but Shane Black’s 2005 neo-noir black comedy is worth revisiting perennially whether or not it technically qualifies as a Christmas movie. In “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,” about a thief-turned-actor in Los Angeles, Christmas is more of a decorative ornament set ironically against all the deliciously unwholesome seediness. (Available for digital rental) — Coyle</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best house swapping fantasy</h2>



<p>“The Holiday” (2006): Ok, so the cozy English cottage isn’t real, but what is? The premise? The romances? Cameron Diaz’s sprint through snowy fields and country roads in stilettos? Mr. Napkin Head? (Actually, maybe Mr. Napkin Head). The thing is it doesn’t really matter, does it? Nancy Meyers’ romantic fantasy is never trying to be anything other than a delightful movie, a little too earnest, a little too glossy and an unabashed ode to the classic movies Meyers loves right down to Eli Wallach teaching a new generation about the “meet cute.” (Streaming on Hulu and Prime Video) —Bahr</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A great Christmas thriller not named “Die Hard”</h2>



<p>“Three Days of the Condor”: I’ll take any excuse to rewatch Sydney Pollack’s 1975 spy thriller with Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway. But, like in “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,” the Christmas backdrop isn’t accidental. If the holidays are the ultimate time of togetherness, “Three Days of the Condor” questions what that means in a post-Watergate world. (Streaming on Paramount+) — Coyle</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best recent kids Christmas movie</h2>



<p>“Klaus”: There’s such a steady stream of mediocre or worse holiday movies that it can be easy to miss when a gem arrives. Sergio Pablos’ 2019 animated Netflix film was basically an origin story for Santa Claus by way of a desperate postman stationed in a remote northern village. Further proof, along with “Miracle on 34th Street,” that the best Christmas movies hinge on the postal service. (Streaming on Netflix) — Coyle</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">For the under-five set</h2>



<p>“Shaun the Sheep: The Flight Before Christmas” (2021): Clocking in at only 30 minutes, this is the perfect film for the littlest ones in the house. It’s sweet, funny and adventurous and not even a little bit scary (unless you fear flying sleighs and botched recipes). (Streaming on Netflix) —Bahr</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best general holiday-period movie</h2>



<p>“Nobody’s Fool”: Robert Benton’s 1994 Richard Russo adaptation, with Paul Newman, spans Thanksgiving through New Year’s Eve. And while that covers Christmas, the richness of “Nobody’s Fool” exceeds its vaguely holiday setting. It’s a movie more about daily smalltown struggles and long-term regrets, yet its warmth could match that any of any more traditional Christmas movie, and then some. That’s much owed to Newman, but there are countless great performances here, including Jessica Tandy (in her final film), a never better Bruce Willis and a young Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a sniveling police officer. It makes me happy just thinking about it. (Streaming on Kanopy, available for digital rental) — Coyle</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">For midcentury style and heartbreak</h2>



<p>“Carol” (2015): Even if Rooney Mara didn’t catch Cate Blanchett’s eye while wearing a Santa hat behind the counter of a Manhattan department store, Todd Haynes’ “Carol” would still be one of the loveliest, most achingly tender Christmas movies around. Romance, heartbreak, plaids and martinis, “Carol” is truly flung out of space. (Streaming on Netflix, Paramount+ and MUBI) —Bahr</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The ultimate TCM Christmas movie</h2>



<p>“Christmas in Connecticut” (1945): You don’t have to watch it on TCM but it’s certainly a fitting place to catch this 1945 screwball classic, with Barbara Stanwyck. She plays a popular homemaking column writer whose false persona as a family woman with a Connecticut farm is challenged when her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) comes for Christmas dinner. As a rule, it’s good to watch everything with Greenstreet. But the central conceit of “Christmas in Connecticut” – that the perfect Christmas is a lie, and isn’t that fun – has proved remarkably durable. (Streaming on WatchTCM) — Coyle</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">For 19th century New England vibes</h2>



<p>“Little Women” (1994 and 2019): Gillian Armstrong’s “Little Women” just feels like Christmas. Maybe part of that is because it came out around the holidays 30 years ago or that its DVD cover leans into it. But then you remember Beth’s piano, the girls stomping through the snow with their Christmas feast, the caroling, the return of their father, the fireplaces and nightcaps and it makes sense. Those wanting all of this with a side of dancing Chalamet, Greta Gerwig’s version is there for the taking too. (1994 version available for digital rental; 2019 streaming on Hulu) — Bahr</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The very best Christmas movie</h2>



<p>“The Shop Around the Corner” (1940): You can make a strong case for that other Jimmy Stewart Christmas movie. But in the knock-down, drag-out battle for the Christmas movie title, there’s no greater delight than Ernst Lubitsch’s timeless love story. One of the most charming movies ever made, partly because it doesn&#8217;t shy away from real darkness, too. It also makes for a very effective drinking game if you sip something every time someone says “Mr. Matuschek.” (Streaming on WatchTCM and Max) — Coyle</p>



<p>“Miracle on 34th Street” (1947): It’s not even a remotely out of the box choice, but George Seaton’s “Miracle on 34th Street” endures as the platonic ideal of a Christmas movie. It’s strikingly modern for something that came out 77 years ago with Maureen O’Hara’s single working mom, Natalie Wood’s prematurely cynical New York kid and the litigious and capitalistic culture and yet it’s all full of hope and holiday spirit (and a healthy amount of glossy capitalism), taking us from the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade through Christmas Day. (Streaming on Disney+, Hulu and Prime Video) — Bahr</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Dennis Rodman is responding to the critical remarks his daughter, soccer star Trinity Rodman,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/trinity-dennis-rodman-call-her-daddy-rcna184663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made about him as a father</a><a href="https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/trinity-dennis-rodman-call-her-daddy-rcna184663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;on a podcast</a><a href="https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/trinity-dennis-rodman-call-her-daddy-rcna184663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">.</a></p>



<p>On the Dec. 18 episode of Alex Cooper’s&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trinity-rodman-the-truth-about-my-family/id1418960261?i=1000680632452" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Call Her Daddy” podcast</a>, Trinity Rodman, 22, said that her NBA legend father, who has made headlines for decades for his wild antics on and off the basketball court, is not &#8220;present&#8221; in her life.</p>



<p>“He’s not a dad,” she said. &#8220;Maybe by blood, but nothing else.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry I wasn’t the Dad you wanted me to be but either way I still tried and I still Try and Never will Stop,&#8221; Dennis Rodman wrote in a response he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDv5u6FxylR/?igsh=MWkzOGJwZnM3MmR0aw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted to Instagram on Dec. 19.</a></p>



<p>TODAY.com reached out to Dennis Rodman for comment about his daughter’s claims after the podcast was released and did not hear back.</p>



<p>The Washington Spirit forward said she&#8217;s hesitated to speak negatively about her estranged father because she never wanted “to make him look bad,” but she wanted to paint a “realistic” picture of his role in her life.</p>



<p>Trinity Rodman told Cooper that her dad abandoned&nbsp;her and her brother, DJ Rodman, 23, after their mom, Michelle Moyer, filed for divorce from him in 2004.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finances at one point became so tight for the trio that they lived in their Ford Expedition, she recalled.</p>

<p>“Before the divorce happened, my dad was actually helping moneywise … but then, when the divorce happened, it was just like, ‘F&#8212; you guys,’” she said.</p>



<p>The Olympic gold medal winner also recalled witnessing her father’s hard-partying lifestyle firsthand when she was growing up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He<strong>&nbsp;</strong>partied all the time,” she said. “He has this beach house … we tried to live with him, but he’s having parties 24/7.”</p>



<p>Trinity Rodman added that she believes her dad “doesn’t know how” to show love to the people in his life.</p>



<p>“His demons were just too strong for it,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Dec. 19, Dennis Rodman posted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDv5u6FxylR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video on Instagram</a>&nbsp;showing a collage of photos of him and Trinity Rodman.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry I wasn’t the Dad you wanted me to be but either way I still tried and I still Try and Never will Stop,&#8221; the former Chicago Bull wrote in his caption. &#8220;I will keep Trying even when you’re being told as an adult not to respond to my phone calls. I will try even when it’s difficult and if it takes a long time.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m always here And tell you all the time rather it’s your voice or voicemail how proud I am,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>Dennis Rodman went on to say that his &#8220;one wish&#8221; was that his children &#8220;would call me and come see me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hopefully one day I can get that. I’m here and I’m still trying pick up the phone you have my number, You see me calling, I’m still here Dennis RODMAN- Dad,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p>In a postscript, he added that he watches his daughter play soccer &#8220;all the time,&#8221; and wrote that he once flew to see her play, but was &#8220;told not to show up bc who I was with.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So I watched you from my hotel balcony just to make everybody happy,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p>The NBA Hall of Famer, who shares an older daughter, Alexis, with ex-wife Annie Bakes, added, &#8220;I love All My Kids.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400">While the longtime couple have been at the </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1406204/did-dakota-johnson-and-chris-martin-break-up-heres-the-truth-about-their-engagement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:400">center of breakup rumors</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> over the past year, the </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/coldplay" target="_blank">Coldplay</a><span style="font-weight:400"> singer seemingly confirmed that he and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/fifty_shades_of_grey" target="_blank">&#8220;</a></span><span style="font-weight:400"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/fifty_shades_of_grey" target="_blank">Fifty Shades of Grey&#8221;</a></span><span style="font-weight:400"> alum are very much together — although they are still hoping to keep their romance out of the spotlight.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;It is important to say that [romantic love] is such a big factor in everything,&#8221; Martin explained to </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/coldplay-chris-martin-music-of-the-spheres-tour-future-1235204333/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:400">Rolling Stone</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> in an interview published on Thursday, &#8220;even though it feels right to keep it precious and private; I&#8217;m not denying its power.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">The outlet noted that Martin, 47, did mention Johnson, 35, several times throughout their interview, saying that the two had recently listened to </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/kacey_musgraves" target="_blank">Kacey Musgraves</a><span style="font-weight:400">&#8216; Golden Hour and calling her one of his best friends alongside children </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.eonline.com/news/1411252/apple-martin-cheekily-addresses-mean-girl-rumors-after-debutante-ball" target="_blank">Apple Martin</a><span style="font-weight:400">, 20, and </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.eonline.com/news/1409956/chris-martin-and-gwyneth-paltrows-son-moses-martin-reveals-his-singing-talents-at-concert" target="_blank">Moses Martin</a><span style="font-weight:400">, 18, whom he shares with ex-wife </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/gwyneth_paltrow" target="_blank">Gwyneth Paltrow</a><span style="font-weight:400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400">It was then reported in August that the two had ended their romance, however </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1406204/did-dakota-johnson-and-chris-martin-break-up-heres-the-truth-about-their-engagement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight:400">a rep confirmed to E! News at the time</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> that it was &#8220;not true,&#8221; adding, &#8220;they are happily together.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">In fact, days after the speculation started, Johnson was seen stepping out in Malibu, California, </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1406245/dakota-johnson-confirms-chris-martin-relationship-status-amid-breakup-rumors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:400">with an emerald ring on her ring finger</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> </span><span style="font-weight:400">—</span> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1218721/dakota-johnsons-bold-ring-on-that-finger-sparks-chris-martin-engagement-rumors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:400">the same one she&#8217;d worn in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">Despite their focus on privacy, Martin and Johnson haven&#8217;t been shy about how much they care for each other, with the &#8220;Madame Web&#8221; star telling </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/06/dakota-johnson-persuasion-cover" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:400">Vanity Fair</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> in 2022 that after they first met, they &#8220;never really left each other.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">They also wanted to keep their romance out of the spotlight as much as they could in part because of Martin&#8217;s family and Johnson&#8217;s own experience growing up in Hollywood as the daughter of </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409735/don-johnson-reveals-daughter-dakota-johnsons-penis-drawing-prank" target="_blank">Don Johnson</a><span style="font-weight:400"> and </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/melanie_griffith" target="_blank">Melanie Griffith</a><span style="font-weight:400">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;Maybe I think about relationships like that differently because I grew up in my family,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;We were all cool. Obviously, there were times where it was not cool, but I experienced that, so I don&#8217;t want that in my life…It&#8217;s better to be kind, and it&#8217;s also really nice that everybody actually really loves each other and has each other&#8217;s backs.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFL</a> is adding a game show and a punting contest to its Pro Bowl skills competitions in February.</p>



<p>The league on Thursday announced the full list of challenges, including tug-of-war and dodgeball.</p>



<p>The games will take place at Central Florida and finish with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/nfc-afc-2024-pro-bowl-games-olympics/" target="_blank">seven-on-seven flag football game</a> between the AFC and NFC on Feb. 2.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">2025 NFL Pro Bowl new events</h2>



<p>The NFL has made two significant additions to the Pro Football Games. First is &#8220;Helmet Harmony,&#8221; a game show that will test players&#8217; knowledge of their teammates.</p>



<p>The second is &#8220;Punt Perfect&#8221; that features one punter and one non-punter. The two players from each conference will punt from the 35-yard line, attempting to place as many balls as possible into a set of six buckets in the end zone.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What is the passing competition at the NFL Pro Bowl?</h2>



<p>The passing and receiving competitions have a new twist this year. Quarterbacks will try to hit targets at various distances around the field worth different point values in 40 seconds. Before the challenge, each quarterback will select a Pro Bowl Games teammate to answer five trivia questions about current Pro Bowl players. For every correct answer, the quarterback gets an additional 10 seconds.</p>



<p>In the catching challenge, one wide receiver, tight end and defensive back from each conference will compete in an obstacle course, including catches from a JUGS machine at three different distances, to test every aspect of catching a football.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Does the Pro Bowl still have tackling?</h2>



<p>The rest of the competitions are a relay race and a great football race where six players from each conference will face off in a relay consisting of five different challenges, culminating with a sled push.</p>



<p>This is the third year of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/here-are-the-afc-and-nfc-rosters-for-the-2024-pro-bowl-games/" target="_blank">Pro Bowl Games</a>&nbsp;after the NFL eliminated its full-contact all-star game and replaced it with weeklong skills competitions and a flag football game.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Who coaches in the Pro Bowl?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/ranking-best-no-1-draft-picks-nfl-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peyton and Eli Manning</a> are back as head coaches for the two conferences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How and when watch NFL stars at the Pro Bowl</h2>



<p>The skills challenges will be broadcast live on Thursday, Jan. 30, on ESPN from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. ET.</p>



<p>The flag football game will be played at Camping World Stadium and will be broadcast at 3 p.m. ET on ESPN and ABC.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;I received a message from Dr Tess, with some urgency to return to Los Angeles,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;as I had 2 locations on My Skin, Shoulder &amp; Forearm, one of which was Melanoma, that should be operated on ASAP.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">The 61-year-old, who appeared on the talk shows earlier this month to chat about his new photography book, said he immediately returned to undergo the procedure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400">Although Julian Lennon</span> <span style="font-weight:400">may not know the details of his biopsy until after the holidays, he emphasized that &#8220;the operation was a success.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">He also urged followers to &#8220;get yourself checked out by your doctor.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;It only takes a short while to do so, and you may just be saving your own life, at the end of the day,&#8221; he shared. &#8220;So please, for the sake of yourself, your family and friends just go to your Dr and do what must be done… I love life and I want to live for a very long time and this is one way, and a choice, that could determine your future.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">In 2020, the &#8220;Too Late for Goodbyes&#8221; singer, who shared that he had successfully removed a mole from his scalp, reflected on the harrowing experience that left him &#8220;shaking inside.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;I cannot tell you how I felt, from One moment of Joy, to the fear of feeling that I may be gone, at any given moment,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.facebook.com/julianlennonofficial/photos/a.99371636116/10157532778786117/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on Facebook at the time. &#8220;I&#8217;m still shaking inside… But My Faith is Strong.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;Life is too Short,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Don&#8217;t make it shorter, by being ignorant about Your Own health. Love to All.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><strong>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411357/ethan-slaters-ex-lilly-jay-addresses-unfairness-of-public-divorce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online</a></strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1381502/ethan-slaters-estranged-wife-lilly-jay-slams-not-a-girls-girl-ariana-grande" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lilly Jay</a>’s life was thrust into the spotlight amid her split from <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411286/why-ariana-grande-is-singing-boyfriend-ethan-slaters-praises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan Slater</a>.</p>



<p>In a personal essay, the clinical psychologist got candid about the ways in which <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1407314/ariana-grandes-boyfriend-ethan-slater-finalizes-divorce-from-wife" target="_blank">her divorce from the Wicked actor</a> — with whom she shares a 2-year-old son — affected her personal life and career as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409738/inside-wicked-costars-ariana-grande-and-ethan-slaters-magical-romance" target="_blank">her former partner moved on with</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/ariana_grande" target="_blank">Ariana Grande</a>, though Jay doesn’t name either by name.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to measure an absence, and I can’t say for sure how much my career has been impacted by what’s out there online,” she wrote in <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/lilly-jay-divorce-essay-therapy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her essay for The Cut</a>, published Dec. 19. “But there have been hints along the way, like the job offer that dissolved without explanation after yet another tabloid news cycle or the patient who’s scheduled for a first appointment but seemingly vanishes.”</p>



<p>She added, “On my darker days, I railed against the unfairness of a public divorce, asking my therapist, ‘Who would trust a cardiologist who had a heart attack because they never got an EKG?’”</p>



<p>Jay — who had been with Slater since high school — also spoke to how she and her former partner had decided to navigate his rising star against her preference for anonymity as a psychologist.</p>



<p><b>READ</b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1381502/ethan-slaters-estranged-wife-lilly-jay-slams-not-a-girls-girl-ariana-grande" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ethan Slater&#8217;s Estranged Wife Lilly Jay Slams &#8220;Not a Girl&#8217;s Girl&#8221; Ariana Grande</a></p>



<p>“My partner was on a different path, in which social media and exposure were not impediments but rather necessities,” she wrote. “We puzzled through this predicament on walks, over pizza, in our apartment and excitedly concocted rules of engagement of how and what he would share about our lives together. It was a tenuous balance — my profession, which requires privacy, and his, which is measured in applause — but it worked well while life was unfolding according to our plans.”</p>



<p>Yet, Jay also spoke to the ways in which her plans did not turn out as she’d expected, including finalizing her divorce with her high school sweetheart in September, two years after welcoming their son in Aug. 2022.</p>



<p>“During my pregnancy, I had never felt happier nor more aware of how precarious happiness could be,” she wrote, adding of welcoming her son, “I survived preeclampsia, a life-threatening birth complication, and finally, our family was whole. Mine is a story of worrying in the wrong direction.”</p>



<p>While noting her knowledge as a psychologist of how challenging the postpartum period can be on a marriage, she continued, “But I confidently moved to another country with my 2-month-old baby and my husband to support his career. Consumed by the magic and mundanity of new motherhood, I didn’t understand the growing distance between us.”</p>



<p>Now, Jay noted how she’s looking to the future amid the public scrutiny on her life.</p>



<p>“I work diligently on my private project of accepting the sudden public downfall of my marriage,” she added. “This, I tell myself, is nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to hide. Slowly but surely, I have come to believe that in the absence of the life I planned with my high-school sweetheart, a lifetime of sweetness is waiting for me and my child.”</p>



<p>She also spoke to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411354/ethan-slaters-ex-lilly-jay-shares-update-on-coparenting-dynamic-after-their-split" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her current dynamic with Slater</a>. “While our partnership has changed, our parenthood has not,” she noted. “Both of us fiercely love our son 100 percent of the time, regardless of how our parenting time is divided.”</p>



<p>For his part, Slater has <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409298/ethan-slater-addresses-really-difficult-speculation-about-ariana-grande-relationship" target="_blank">previously spoken to the public backlash</a> his and Grande&#8217;s relationship garnered amid rumors of infidelity.</p>



<p>“I think there was something that was really difficult about things in your private life being commented on and looked at by the public,” he told <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> in October. “There were a lot of big changes in private lives that were really happening, so it’s really hard to see people who don’t know anything about what’s happening commenting on it.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile Grande has steadfastly <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1407959/ariana-grande-slams-rumors-about-ethan-slater-relationship" target="_blank">supported her partner’s character</a>.</p>



<p>“There couldn’t be a less accurate depiction of a human being than the one that the tabloids spread about him,” she told <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wicked-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-cover" target="_blank">Vanity Fair</a> in November. “No one on this earth tries harder or spreads themselves thinner to be there for the people that he loves and cares about.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>I&#8217;d like a hotel room, please&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230;with an extra-large bed, a TV, and one of those little refrigerators you have to open with a key.</p>



<p>And I’d also like a limousine, a pizza and a 16-scoop ice cream sundae.</p>



<p>Each of these requests can be accommodated at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, just as they were for Kevin McCallister more than 30 years ago.</p>



<p>The iconic venue’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theplazany.com/special-offers/home-alone-fun-in-new-york/" target="_blank">“Home Alone: Fun in New York” package</a> offers guests the opportunity to spend a day in the life of Kevin — the family-vacation dodging, booby-trap setting, burglar-stopping 9-year-old who once fictionally checked in there.</p>



<p>Available year-round for hotel guests to add to their visit, the special experience is also often requested for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Of course, it takes on an extra special feel at Christmastime.</p>



<p>When given the chance to experience a version of this, I took it.</p>



<p>I literally followed in Kevin McCallister&#8217;s footsteps, entering the very lobby he walked through, repeating the very lines he said, wearing the very outfit he wore: a green jacket, khaki pants and a pom-pom beanie. There was a backpack over my shoulders, a Talkboy in my hand and an overwhelming desire to recreate movie scenes racing through my mind.</p>



<p>A Hollywood fantasy was about to become my reality. To fully capitalize on the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I needed advice from someone who had already experienced it.</p>



<p>So, I asked Macaulay Culkin.</p>

<p>The beloved actor who played Kevin happened to be in the tri-state area around the time of my stay for his nostalgic <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/star-of-home-alone-to-hold-movie-screening-qa-in-chicago-area-as-part-of-nostalgia-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Home Alone” movie screening tour</a> that included Q&amp;A sessions and meet-and-greets.</p>



<p>His advice to me on everything from pizza to ice cream will remain between the real Kevin McCallister and fake (see: myself). But both have now stayed at the Plaza Hotel, and both have said…</p>



<p>Now <em>this</em> is a vacation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>THE RESERVATION: ‘Howdy do’</strong></h2>



<p>First, I needed to buy a cassette tape and batteries for the Talkboy.</p>



<p>I then learned that unlike in “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York” – scenes of which were filmed at the Plaza – it’s not so simple to reserve a room using Kevin’s tape-recording, voice-altering 1990s toy.</p>



<p>I know because I tried. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>After I called the hotel and pressed play, despite the agent’s best effort to assist, the pre-recorded message by “Peter McCallister, the father,” did not provide the adequate information needed to secure a room at the world-renowned luxury hotel.</p>



<p>Online booking didn’t exist in Kevin’s day – nor did smartphones and their power-outage-immune alarm clocks, mobile boarding passes or location-tracking apps that would have derailed the plot of the movie. But, nowadays, it’s the most convenient and preferred method to reserve a room. And guess what’s typically required to do so?</p>



<p>Credit card? You got it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>THE CHECK IN: &#8216;Reservation for McCallister</strong>&#8216;</h2>



<p>Bellmen on the steps outside of the Fifth Avenue lobby greeted guests as they made their way inside. I entered through the iconic revolving door that leads into the majestic hotel lobby, with Christmas trees and holiday décor beneath a glistening crystal chandelier. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//2024/12/Gavin-Plaza-lobby.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Towering arched doorways opened to The Palm Court, a popular setting for afternoon tea that’s adjacent to the corridor where Kevin asked a future president for directions to the lobby.  </p>



<p>I walked past the concierge desk – there was no sign of Cedric counting his tips in public, and Mr. Hector must have been somewhere investigating a stolen credit card or inflatable clown – and over to the elevators that led to the suite. I considered doing a running slide across the marble floor and through the elevator door but didn’t because I wouldn’t slide nearly as far as Kevin McCallister. Plus, I didn’t want to get into mischief.</p>



<p>And ma’am, sometimes I do get into mischief. We all do! &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>THE SUITE: ‘This is one of our finest suites, sir’</strong></h2>



<p>A private elevator took me up to the Royal Suite – the Plaza Hotel’s most extraordinary offering.</p>



<p>The “Home Alone” package can be added to any of the hotel’s guestroom or suites year-round, with a starting price of $2,160 plus tax.</p>



<p>This palatial suite — priced at more than $40,000 per night — is fit for royalty, celebrities and guests of “The New Celebrity Ding-Dang-Dong.” But on this day, it was host to some guy dressed as a kid from a 1990s movie.</p>

<p>The 4,500-square-foot room includes three bedrooms and four bathrooms. An entrance gallery led into a living room with a grand piano and a dining room with a table that seats 12.</p>



<p>Forget about a little refrigerator you have to open with a key, this suite has a full chef’s kitchen – as well as a library and a fully-equipped gym.</p>



<p>The primary bedroom not only has an extra-large bed ideal for jumping on, but also a fireplace, picture windows overlooking Fifth Avenue, and a dressing area with leather and wood-paneled closets.</p>



<p>That leads into the primary bathroom, where plush bath robes await, including a tiny one for your dog. Yes, even pups get pampered at the Plaza.</p>



<p>I stared in the mirror, situated above double sinks featuring 24-carat gold-plated fixtures. I contemplated shaving my beard for the occasion until I remembered how loudly Kevin screamed after being burned by after-shave lotion. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I stood on the bathroom’s heated floor, surrounded by private water closets and an antique tub that on this day was filled with bottles of champagne on ice.</p>



<p>Luxurious … and spacious. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>THE LIMO: ‘A limousine and a pizza, compliments of the Plaza Hotel&#8217;</strong></h2>



<p>I exited the lobby, walked down the stairs, and approached a stretch limousine that was waiting for me in the very spot where it once picked up Kevin.</p>



<p>Waiting inside my chariot were eight slices of pure New York heaven.</p>



<p>Mr. McCallister, here’s your very own cheese pizza.</p>

<p>I stretched my legs on the back seat while enjoying a slice, and I washed it down with a can of Coca-Cola that I poured into a champagne glass.</p>



<p>You can dine like Kevin while the limo drives around New York City for four hours, stopping at landmark filming locations from the movie like Radio City Music Hall, Carnegie Hall and Central Park.</p>



<p>The latter is just across the street from the Plaza, so I went for a stroll in the park. I didn’t see the Pigeon Lady, but I did see her pigeons. They were right by the bridge where Kevin gave her the turtle dove on Christmas morning. And, by the way, Kevin…you couldn’t invite her into your huge suite at the Plaza for a warm meal instead of giving her an ornament?! Anyway…</p>



<p>I made my way to Rockefeller Center and stood in the very spot where Kevin was reunited with his mother. </p>



<p>I looked at the tree in amazement while others looked at me in confusion, wondering why they were seeing a grown man dressed as Kevin McCallister. </p>



<p>One person even shouted, “KEVIN!!!”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>THE STAFF: ‘Your drawers, sir&#8217;</strong></h2>



<p>My bag was packed with movie props &#8212; no, I did not bring a rope soaked in kerosene or any other booby trap supplies.</p>



<p>I did bring a copy of the New York Times with mugshots of Harry and Marv on the cover, a VHS copy of the fictional movie Kevin watches in the suite titled “Angels With Even Filthier Souls,” and a pair of freshly pressed boxer shorts on a hanger. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And yes, I asked Plaza staff members to play a role in scene recreations. Evan knocked on my suite door while holding the hanger and said, “Your drawers, sir.” Eddie graciously allowed me to tip him with sticks of gum, and I told him there’s plenty more where that came from.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//2024/12/Gavin-Plaza-gum.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The Plaza staff has recreated far more meaningful scenes from the movie while partnering with the Make-a-Wish foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hotel welcomes Wish Children throughout the holiday season to experience the “Home Alone” package. One child dreamt of being chased through the hotel by the Sticky Bandits. So, Daniel Brigano, the hotel’s guest experience director, and Benjamin Beraha, the food and beverage manager, dressed up as Harry and Marv and reenacted scenes in the lobby to make that wish come true.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>THE HOME ALONE SUNDAE: ‘Two scoops, sir?’</strong></h2>



<p>Two? Make it three…or four…or 16. I’m not driving. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cherry on top of my stay at the Plaza Hotel was rolled into my suite on a cart by a butler wearing white gloves.</p>



<p>He placed in front of me a decadent sterling silver platter, at the center of which was 16 scoops of ice cream topped with whipped cream. It was surrounded by an assortment of toppings, including M&amp;M’s, rainbow sprinkles, brownie bits and maraschino cherries. An array of sauces &#8212; chocolate, caramel and raspberry – were available for drizzling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//2024/12/Gavin-Plaza-sundae.jpg?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>I sat, alone, eating an ice cream sundae in one of the world’s most renowned hotels. I wondered if I spent $967 on room service, I waited for an invasion by the Sticky Bandits that never came, I reflected on my day as Kevin at the Plaza.</p>



<p>From the lobby to the limo, the pizza to the Plaza staff, and the suite to the sundae, all I could say was…. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now <em>this</em> is a vacation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zach Gilford is unrecognizable in a photo he shared of his swollen face as he recovers from an unspecified health event.</p>



<p>The 42-year-old &#8220;Criminal Minds: Evolution&#8221; star posted a shocking image of himself wearing a medical mask over his swollen face Dec. 17 in his Instagram story.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good thing we wrapped @criminalminds last week,&#8221; he joked in writing over the pic.</p>



<p>The photo shows Gilford&#8217;s puffy eyes nearly swollen shut. His cheeks also appear to filled with edema.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/zach-gilford-3-jp-241218-eeceb8.webp?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="Zach Gilford" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Zach Gilford showed an image of his swollen face on social media. (@zachgilord7 via Instagram)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Gilford added a second photo to show that his facial swelling had begun to reside. &#8220;Thanks to all the nurses, doctors, and staff at @hungtingtonhospital for coaxing my face back to normalcy,&#8221; he wrote on that image, adding, &#8220;&#8230;still a little ways to go.&#8221;</p>



<p>TODAY.com reached out to a rep for Gilford for comment.</p>



<p>While Gilford has not publicly revealed his diagnosis, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/facial-swelling" target="_blank">Cleveland Clinic</a> explains that facial swelling happens when fluid builds up in the tissues of one&#8217;s face.</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img style="margin-bottom: 0px" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/12/zach-gilford-2-jp-241218-fc106c.webp?w=900&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="Zach Gilford" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Zach Gilford showed a look of his swollen face on social media. (@zachgilord7 via Instagram)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A swollen or bloated face can have many causes, and it can also be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, such as lupus or Cushing&#8217;s disease.</p>



<p>The most common causes of facial swelling include, according to the Cleveland Clinic:</p>



<ul>
<li>Allergic reactions</li>



<li>Drug reactions</li>



<li>Facial trauma, including injuries like a broken nose</li>



<li>Infections&nbsp;that may involve your face, such as&nbsp;cellulitis,&nbsp;pink eye&nbsp;and&nbsp;sinusitis</li>
</ul>



<p>The Cleveland Clinic notes also that certain conditions, like lipomas and cysts, can cause swelling of one side of one&#8217;s face. Medical conditions involving the salivary glands, lymph nodes and teeth can also cause a face to swell, as can autoimmune diseases like lupus or hyperthyroidism.</p>



<p>A swollen face can also be a symptom of anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction.</p>



<p>Facial swelling is commonly treated with antibiotics, antihistamines or corticosteroids&nbsp;depending on the cause.</p>



<p>In the case of anaphylaxis, patients are treated with Epinephrine auto-injector, or EPIPEN, to get the allergic reaction and its symptoms under control.</p>



<p>Gilford, in addition to &#8220;Criminal Minds,&#8221; is known for his work on &#8220;Friday Night Lights,&#8221; &#8220;Midnight Mass&#8221; and the &#8220;Midnight Club.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>“The Masked Singer” Season 12 has a winner.</p>



<p>Another group of celebrities hid behind elaborate costumes and belted out tunes — with only one being awarded the Golden Mask trophy</p>



<p>The Dec. 19 finale saw Wasp and Buffalos battle it out for the chance to be crowned this season&#8217;s winner. Season Five winner Nick Lachey opened the show with a festive rendition of “It’s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year.”</p>



<p>Hosted by Nick Cannon, panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg, Rita Ora and Ken Jeong<strong> </strong>had been taking their best guesses at who the stars under the masks were.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Who won Season 12 of &#8216;The Masked Singer&#8217;?</h2>



<p><strong>Buffalos</strong></p>



<p><strong>Who was under the mask? </strong>Boyz II Men</p>



<p>Buffalos were crowned the winner of “The Masked Singer” Season 12.</p>



<p>After surprising the panelists when they stepped out as a trio during the first episode, Buffalo had been a fan favorite.</p>



<p>Their first performance of the night was “Somebody That I Used To Know” by Gotye. They returned to the stage to sing “Too Good At Goodbyes”&nbsp;by Sam Smith.</p>



<p>By the end of the episode, the panelists were confident that the trio behind the masks was the iconic R&amp;B group.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Who was the runner-up?</h2>



<p><strong>Wasp</strong></p>



<p><strong>Who was under the mask? </strong>Mario</p>



<p>Wasp first performed “When I Was Your Man” by Bruno Mars, followed by “I’m Your Baby Tonight” by Whitney Houston.</p>



<p>Among the final guesses from the panelists included Jason Derulo and Usher.</p>



<p>However, Ora and Thicke were on the nose and correctly guessed Mario.</p>



<p>Season 12 was filled with fun theme nights that celebrated blockbuster movies, as well as music from iconic superstars. This season of “The Masked Singer” also included hidden clues&nbsp;<em>everywhere</em>&nbsp;—&nbsp;“embedded in&nbsp;costumes, in song choices, packages and on-stage moments,” the press release noted.</p>



<p>Last season, disguised under the Goldfish costume, Vanessa Hudgens was crowned&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/the-masked-singer-season-11-every-celebrity-revealed-rcna136866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Season 11 champion</a>&nbsp;during the May 22 finale.</p>



<p>Here’s everything to know about Season 12 of “The Masked Singer.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When did Season 12 of &#8216;The Masked Singer&#8217; premiere?</h2>



<p>“The Masked Singer” returned for its 12th season on Wednesday, Sept. 25, at 8 p.m. ET on Fox.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Who were the Season 12 contestants?</h2>

<p><strong>Who was under the mask?</strong>&nbsp;John Elway</p>



<p>Former NFL quarterback star John Elway sang “I Like It, I Love It” by Tim McGraw.</p>

<p>Prior to the “Community” star being revealed, Jeong was confident that it was his former co-star and friend. Thicke joined him in guessing the same person, while McCarthy Wahlberg believed it was Taraji P. Henson and Ora thought it was musician Sheila E.</p>



<p>Following the unmasking, Brown said he was “getting emotional” and said her participation in the show was “a love letter” to Jeong and that music was her first love.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Woodpecker in Episode 3</h2>



<p><strong>Who was under the mask?&nbsp;</strong>Marsai Martin</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/taylor_swift">Taylor Swift</a><span style="font-weight:400">&#8216;s birthday made the whole place shimmer.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">The &#8220;Bejeweled&#8221; singer recently marked her 35th birthday on </span><span style="font-weight:400">Dec. 13, </span><span style="font-weight:400">and fans were lucky enough to get a peek at the festivities thanks to </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/brittany_mahomes">Brittany Mahomes</a><span style="font-weight:400">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">The 28-year-old — who is expecting baby no. 3 with </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/travis_kelce">Travis Kelce</a><span style="font-weight:400">&#8216;s Kansas City Chiefs teammate </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/patrick_mahomes">Patrick Mahomes</a><span style="font-weight:400"> </span><span style="font-weight:400">—shared a slew of photos to her </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDvDVzAR17m/?img_index=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:400">Instagram Dec. 18</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> showing off the epic party, which appeared to take its theme from Taylor&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411052/taylor-swift-has-just-9-words-after-eras-tour-ends"><span style="font-weight:400">recently wrapped Eras Tour</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">.  In one pic, Swift and Mahomes posed with their arms wrapped around each other, while Taylor also took a sip of her cocktail.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">Alongside the carousel of images, Mahomes captioned the post, &#8220;My people.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">While Mahomes</span> <span style="font-weight:400">appeared to callback to Swift&#8217;s Midnights era by sporting a silver fringe dress, black fringe jacket and sparkly boots for the occasion, Patrick Mahomes — with whom she also shares daughter </span>Sterling<span style="font-weight:400">, 3, son </span>Bronze<span style="font-weight:400">, 2—appeared to give </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1404587/travis-kelce-reveals-how-he-ended-up-joining-taylor-swift-on-the-eras-tour-stage"><span style="font-weight:400">a nod to Travis&#8217; Eras Tour appearance</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> with his outfit. For his look, he rocked a black tuxedo with tails, a white bowtie and, most crucially, a white flower on his lapel.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">As for Swift, fans think she was paying homage to a look from her </span><span style="font-weight:400">Fearless</span> <span style="font-weight:400">era in a black, Balmain halter minidress, which retails for $4,290 on </span><a href="https://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/balmain-halterneck-knit-dress-item-24461214.aspx"><span style="font-weight:400">Farfetch</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">And the</span><span style="font-weight:400"> Grammy winner completed her look with a red friendship bracelet and a pair of diamond </span><a href="https://www.debeers.com/en-us/arpeggia-one-line-earrings-in-white-gold/E102154.html"><span style="font-weight:400">De Beers</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> Arpeggia One Line Earrings, which go for a cool $36,000.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">And fans noticed several other costumes in the photos that also appeared to reference one of Swift&#8217;s many album eras. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;DID THEY HAVE AN ERAS THEMED BDAY PARTY FOR TAYLOR ??????&#8221; one fan </span><a href="https://x.com/corneliastagain/status/1869501062522237354"><span style="font-weight:400">excitedly wrote on X</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">, formerly Twitter, noting the similarities between the outfits worn in Mahomes&#8217; photos and Swift&#8217;s many musical eras. &#8220;THE FRINGE KARMA-ESQUE JACKET??? FEARLESS DRESS???? THE MAN BLAZER ???? SNAKE PLUSH ???? HELLOOO.&#8221; </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">Swift&#8217;s celebration was just the latest in a string of big moments for the &#8220;Karma&#8221; singer, as in addition to finishing her Eras Tour, </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411128/taylor-swift-celebrates-nicest-birthday-present-in-history-making-billboard-music-awards-win"><span style="font-weight:400">she made history at the 2024 Billboard Music Award</span></a> <span style="font-weight:400">on Dec. 12 as the top winner in history with 49 trophies.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;This is, like, the nicest early birthday present you could have given me,&#8221; Swift gushed in her pre-taped acceptance speech video at the event</span><span style="font-weight:400">. &#8220;So, </span><span style="font-weight:400">thank you very much. I love it. It&#8217;s exactly what I wanted.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">But that&#8217;s not all she was up to </span><span style="font-weight:400">ahead of her birthday. The day before her big day, the </span><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;Fortnight&#8221; singer also made time to </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411116/taylor-swifts-young-fans-detail-surreal-experience-meeting-her-at-kansas-city-childrens-hospital"><span style="font-weight:400">visit children being treated</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> at Kansas City&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Mercy Hospital, which elated both the children and their parents.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">One first grader </span><a href="https://x.com/swifferupdates/status/1867340226223649241"><span style="font-weight:400">told local reporters</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> after Swift&#8217;s visit, &#8220;I told her my favorite song, ‘Bad Blood.&#8217; She said I made her day.&#8221;</span></p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Between the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFL</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/nba/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA</a>, there will be plenty of sports on <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christmas</a>. But there&#8217;s a special treat for music fans, too.</p>



<p>Beyoncé will <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/beyonce-halftime-ravens-texans-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perform live at halftime</a> of Wednesday&#8217;s game between the Baltimore Ravens and Houston Texans, which will give fans some added entertainment during the NFL&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/nfl-christmas-day-games-netflix-broadcast-streaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first games on Netflix</a>.</p>



<p>The 43-year-old star singer is no stranger to the NFL, having performed during the halftime show at Super Bowl XLVII in 2013 and Super Bowl 50 in 2016.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s all the info you need to watch her Christmas performance:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When is Beyoncé&#8217;s NFL Christmas show?</h2>



<p>Beyoncé will perform during halftime of the Ravens vs. Texans game on Wednesday, Dec. 25.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What time is Beyoncé&#8217;s NFL Christmas show?</h2>



<p>The game will kick off 4:30 p.m. ET, so halftime is expected to be around 6 p.m. ET.</p>



<p>Halftime will last 15 minutes, which is shorter than the extended Super Bowl halftime break.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Two marquee <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFL</a> matchups are coming to Netflix this holiday season.</p>



<p>The streaming giant <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/nfl-christmas-day-games-netflix-broadcast-streaming/" target="_blank">will broadcast live NFL games for the first time</a> on Christmas Day, and it will get a chance to showcase two showdowns with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/nfl/nfl-teams-clinch-eliminated-playoffs-2024-25" target="_blank">major playoff implications</a>.</p>



<p>First, the two-time defending Super Bowl champion <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/kansas-city-chiefs" target="_blank">Kansas City Chiefs</a> will travel to Pittsburgh to face the Steelers. Then, the Houston Texans will host the Baltimore Ravens with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/beyonce-halftime-ravens-texans-christmas/" target="_blank">Beyoncé taking center stage at halftime</a>.</p>



<p>Netflix has already dipped its toes into the NFL in recent years. It followed up its 2023 &#8220;Quarterback&#8221; series with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/netflix-announces-receiver-nfl-docuseries/" target="_blank">&#8220;Receiver&#8221;</a> follow-up this past summer. Netflix also brought in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/stars-turn-out-to-roast-tom-brady-in-netflix-special-bill-belichick-steals-the-show/" target="_blank">Tom Brady for &#8220;The Greatest Roast of All Time&#8221;</a> during the spring.</p>



<p>The company made a big swing with its most recent live sports event. It aired the boxing exhibition between <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/who-won-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight" target="_blank">Jake Paul and Mike Tyson</a>, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/what-happened-with-netflix-during-the-mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-heres-what-we-know/" target="_blank">viewers shared their complaints</a> about streaming problems throughout the event with thousands citing outages. Still, Netflix said it was the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/money-report/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-was-the-most-streamed-sporting-event-ever-netflix-says/" target="_blank">most-streamed sporting event ever</a> with 108 million global viewers.</p>



<p>Before Netflix kicks off its first ever live NFL coverage, here&#8217;s everything you need to know to watch the games.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When are the Netflix NFL games on Christmas?</h2>



<p>The Chiefs-Steelers and Ravens-Texans games will be played on Wednesday, Dec. 25.</p>



<p>They will be just the third and fourth NFL regular season games to be played on a Wednesday, respectively. The most recent was a Ravens-Steelers matchup in 2020 that was <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/how-to-watch-wednesdays-ravens-steelers-game-on-nbc10-boston/2246060/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">postponed three times</a> due to positive COVID-19 tests.</p>

<p><strong><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411269/chance-the-rappers-wife-kirsten-corley-officially-files-for-divorce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online</a></em></strong></p>



<p>The sun has come down on Chance the Rapper’s marriage.</p>



<p>The Grammy winner’s estranged wife, Kristen Corley, filed for divorce Dec. 13 after nearly six years of marriage, according to court records obtained by E! News.</p>



<p>The former couple, both 31, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1398732/chance-the-rapper-and-wife-kirsten-corley-break-up-after-5-years-of-marriage">announced their separation</a> in April in a statement shared on their respective social media accounts, noting that they had already been taking time apart.</p>



<p>“After a period of separation,” the statement read, “the two of us have arrived at the decision to part ways.”</p>



<p>The pair, who share daughters Kensli, 9, and Marli, 5, went on to declare their commitment to coparenting.</p>



<p>“We came to this decision amicably and with gratitude for the time we spent together,” the post continued. “God has blessed us with two beautiful daughters who we will continue to raise together.”</p>



<p>Chance the Rapper — real name Chancelor Bennett — met Corley at one of his mother’s office parties when they were both about 9 years old, he shared on <a href="https://x.com/chancetherapper/status/1103380486355853313">X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>



<p>After they later began dating, they welcomed Kensli in 2015, and the following year, Corley filed a petition asking that Chance the Rapper be declared the father and ordered to pay child support, according to court documents seen by the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2016/05/26/chance-the-rapper-working-on-parenting-agreement-for-his-daughter/">Chicago Tribune</a>.</p>



<p>The pair eventually reconciled and exchanged vows in a <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1022272/chance-the-rapper-marries-kirsten-corley-inside-their-star-studded-wedding">lavish 2019 wedding</a> in Newport Beach, Calif., with a star-studded guest list including <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/kim_kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> and then-husband <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/kanye_west">Kanye West</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/dave_chappelle">Dave Chappelle</a>. Prior to the oceanfront affair, they wed in a civil ceremony in December 2018, according to a marriage certificate obtained by the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2019/03/07/chance-the-husband-the-rapper-married-longtime-girlfriend-in-a-civil-ceremony-in-2018/">Tribune</a> at the time.</p>



<p>And in 2020, the “No Problem” rapper shared just how much family life had impacted him.</p>



<p>“I’ve been waking up daily with a newfound gratitude and being very grateful that I’m married right now,” he told <a href="https://people.com/parents/chance-the-rapper-daughters-make-laugh-often-home/">People</a>. “The fact that me, my daughters and my wife all live in one house together is a huge, huge blessing, so I’ve just been taking that in.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/music-&amp;-musicians/" target="_blank">Megan Thee Stallion</a> asked a court on Tuesday to issue a restraining order against Tory Lanez, who she says is harassing her from prison through surrogates as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/crime-and-courts/" target="_blank">he serves a 10-year sentence</a> for shooting her in the feet. </p>



<p>The petition filed by the hip-hop star in Los Angeles Superior Court asks the judge to prevent the Canadian rapper Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, from using third parties to continue the same online harassment of Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, that he engaged in and encouraged before his imprisonment.</p>



<p>“Even now, while behind bars, Mr. Peterson shows no signs of stopping,” the petition says. &#8220;Despite being sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Ms. Pete, Mr. Peterson continues to to subject her to repeated trauma and revictimization.&#8221;</p>



<p>The petition says prison call logs from Lanez at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi show that he is coordinating attacks on Megan&#8217;s credibility.</p>



<p>An email seeking comment from Lanez&#8217;s lawyers was not immediately returned. A court hearing on the order is scheduled for Jan. 9.</p>



<p>The filing says bloggers acting on Lanez behalf continue to cast doubt on her allegations, making false claims including that the gun and bullet fragments in the case are missing.</p>



<p>The petition says the protective order issued to prevent the previous harassment is no longer in effect, which it calls a loophole and flaw in the criminal justice system.</p>



<p>In December 2022, Lanez was&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-megan-thee-stallion-tory-lanez-92e6ac82c072da5e17feaf0c3ca5b1d5">convicted of three felonies</a>: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.</p>



<p>A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez&#8217;s lawyers, who are appealing his conviction.</p>

<p>In August of last year, he received the 10-year sentence, bringing what seemed to be a conclusion to a three-year legal and cultural saga that saw two careers, and lives, thrown into turmoil.</p>



<p>The petition says that one blogger in particular, Elizabeth Milagro Cooper, whom Megan is suing in a separate lawsuit, is acting as Lanez “puppet and mouthpiece.” She alleges Cooper is spreading falsehoods on social media and YouTube, saying in one video posted to X, “Can you even prove she was shot?&#8221; and calling her a “professional victim” in another post.</p>



<p>Cooper&#8217;s attorney Michael Pancier declined comment on the California petition, and said in an email that their forthcoming response to the separate federal lawsuit against her will speak for itself.</p>



<p>A previous motion to dismiss Megan&#8217;s lawsuit said it makes “dubious legal claims” and “irrelevant and impertinent allegations.”</p>



<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/canada-music-los-angeles-hip-hop-and-rap-422c2ae365a6f3a92d6902dcad7f4ff5">Megan testified</a>&nbsp;during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner&#8217;s Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding. She revealed who had fired the gun only months later.</p>



<p>The case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/shootings-ca-state-wire-hip-hop-and-rap-entertainment-music-372c80771a649d458d675e356733cd4c">the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police</a>, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity,&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/los-angeles-megan-thee-stallion-hip-hop-and-rap-tory-lanez-shootings-9bca6a240fa685a93066f68592d06381">protecting Black women</a>&nbsp;and the ramifications of&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/megan-thee-stallion-misogynoir-79b40b7a47f8f208715e47f8683b2e04">misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience</a>.</p>



<p>Megan Thee Stallion, now 29, was already a major rising star at the time of the shooting, and her music’s popularity has soared since. She won a Grammy for best new artist in 2021, and she had No. 1 singles with “Savage,” featuring&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/hub/beyonce-knowles">Beyoncé</a>, and as a guest on&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/hub/cardi-b">Cardi B’s</a>&nbsp;“WAP.”</p>



<p>Lanez, 32, began releasing mixtapes in 2009 and saw a steady rise in popularity, moving on to major label albums. His last two reached the top 10 on Billboard’s charts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/jim_carrey">Jim Carrey</a><span style="font-weight:400">&#8216;s return to Hollywood has been b-e-a-utiful.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">In fact, taking a break from Tinseltown proved to be exactly what the &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight:400">Sonic the Hedgehog 3&#8243;</span><span style="font-weight:400"> actor needed to give him a new perspective on his career. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;I think whenever you step away from something — even if it&#8217;s something you love — you get a new appreciation for it,&#8221; Carrey exclusively told E! News&#8217; </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/francesca_amiker">Francesca Amiker</a><span style="font-weight:400"> at the film&#8217;s Los Angeles premiere on Dec. 16. &#8220;A different angle on the whole thing.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">As the 62-year-old explained, he&#8217;s never taken himself &#8220;too seriously,&#8221; so he enjoyed the time away.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">Plus, the move gave his fans a chance to actually miss him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;I also value getting out of people&#8217;s faces,&#8221; Carrey said in the interview, airing on E! News Dec. 17, at 11 p.m. &#8220;I mean, some people just want to be in people&#8217;s faces all the time, and I don&#8217;t, so I like to give them a rest.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400">The &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight:400">Truman Show&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight:400"> star is especially grateful that his fans have stuck with him for all these years, adding, &#8220;I appreciate it. I&#8217;m gratified by it.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">Recently, </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411020/jim-carrey-reveals-money-inspired-his-return-to-acting-in-candid-paycheck-confession"><span style="font-weight:400">Carrey joked that the reason he came out of retirement</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> for &#8220;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&#8221; —hitting theaters Dec. 20— wasn&#8217;t only because he was excited to play the character of Dr. Robotnik again (as well as his grandfather Gerard Robotnik): There was also a far more practical reason.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;I bought a lot of stuff,&#8221; he told the </span><a href="https://x.com/APEntertainment/status/1866579281045811233"><span style="font-weight:400">Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">, &#8220;and I need the money, frankly.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">The candid confession came two years after the &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1359006/you-mightve-missed-this-how-the-grinch-stole-christmas-editing-error"><span style="font-weight:400">How the Grinch Stole Christmas</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight:400"> alum originally </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1325523/why-jim-carrey-is-probably-retiring-after-sonic-the-hedgehog-2"><span style="font-weight:400">discussed retiring from acting for good</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;I&#8217;m being fairly serious,&#8221; he told </span><a><span style="font-weight:400">Access Hollywood</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> March 2022. &#8220;If the angels bring some sort of script that&#8217;s written in gold ink that says to me that it&#8217;s gonna be really important for people to see, I might continue down the road. But I&#8217;m taking a break.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">As Carrey explained at the time, he was very much enjoying his &#8220;quiet life,&#8221; as well as taking time to paint and focus on his &#8220;spiritual life.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;I have enough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done enough. I am enough.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>James Kennedy says he’s changing his ways.</p>



<p>After the &#8220;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/vanderpump_rules" target="_blank">Vanderpump Rules</a>&#8221; star <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411076/vanderpump-rules-james-kennedy-arrested-for-domestic-violence" target="_blank">was arrested Dec. 10 </a>and booked for misdemeanor domestic violence, he broke his silence on his personal troubles.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am committed to making meaningful changes in my life,&#8221; he wrote on his Instagram Story Dec. 17. &#8220;I am taking time to focus on my sobriety, personal growth, and being present for loved ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kennedy — who has been dating Ally Lewber for two years—shared that he believes the road ahead will be difficult.</p>



<p>&#8220;Navigating challenging moments is not easy,&#8221; the 32-year-old added, &#8220;but I am determined to learn, grow, and move forward with the incredible support system around me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Burbank Police Department was called to a local home around 11:30 p.m. on Dec. 10 after someone reported that Kennedy was in an argument with an unnamed woman. A woman inside the house stated that &#8220;her boyfriend lifted her up and threw her to the ground,&#8221; according to an arrest log obtained by E! News.</p>

<p>Kennedy was taken into custody for misdemeanor domestic violence and eventually posted bail of $20,000, before <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411177/james-kennedy-returns-to-work-after-domestic-violence-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">returning to work four days later</a> at The Rave Eagles Club in Milwaukee, Wisc.</p>



<p>As for Lewber, she <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411105/what-james-kennedys-girlfriend-ally-lewber-did-one-day-after-his-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stepped out the day after Kennedy&#8217;s arrest</a> to host a holiday party for fashion brand Windsor at the Short Stories Hotel in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you to everyone who has reached out with love and support and for checking in on me,&#8221; she wrote on her Instagram Stories Dec. 14. &#8220;I&#8217;m okay and taking the time I need right now. I deeply appreciate all the kindness and respect for my privacy during this time.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1381502/ethan-slaters-estranged-wife-lilly-jay-slams-not-a-girls-girl-ariana-grande" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lilly Jay</a>’s life was thrust into the spotlight amid her split from <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411286/why-ariana-grande-is-singing-boyfriend-ethan-slaters-praises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan Slater</a>.</p>



<p>In a personal essay, the clinical psychologist got candid about the ways in which <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1407314/ariana-grandes-boyfriend-ethan-slater-finalizes-divorce-from-wife" target="_blank">her divorce from the Wicked actor</a> — with whom she shares a 2-year-old son — affected her personal life and career as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409738/inside-wicked-costars-ariana-grande-and-ethan-slaters-magical-romance" target="_blank">her former partner moved on with</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/ariana_grande" target="_blank">Ariana Grande</a>, though Jay doesn’t name either by name.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to measure an absence, and I can’t say for sure how much my career has been impacted by what’s out there online,” she wrote in <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/lilly-jay-divorce-essay-therapy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her essay for The Cut</a>, published Dec. 19. “But there have been hints along the way, like the job offer that dissolved without explanation after yet another tabloid news cycle or the patient who’s scheduled for a first appointment but seemingly vanishes.”</p>



<p>She added, “On my darker days, I railed against the unfairness of a public divorce, asking my therapist, ‘Who would trust a cardiologist who had a heart attack because they never got an EKG?’”</p>



<p>Jay — who had been with Slater since high school — also spoke to how she and her former partner had decided to navigate his rising star against her preference for anonymity as a psychologist.</p>



<p><b>READ</b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1381502/ethan-slaters-estranged-wife-lilly-jay-slams-not-a-girls-girl-ariana-grande" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ethan Slater&#8217;s Estranged Wife Lilly Jay Slams &#8220;Not a Girl&#8217;s Girl&#8221; Ariana Grande</a></p>



<p>“My partner was on a different path, in which social media and exposure were not impediments but rather necessities,” she wrote. “We puzzled through this predicament on walks, over pizza, in our apartment and excitedly concocted rules of engagement of how and what he would share about our lives together. It was a tenuous balance — my profession, which requires privacy, and his, which is measured in applause — but it worked well while life was unfolding according to our plans.”</p>



<p>Yet, Jay also spoke to the ways in which her plans did not turn out as she’d expected, including finalizing her divorce with her high school sweetheart in September, two years after welcoming their son in Aug. 2022.</p>



<p>“During my pregnancy, I had never felt happier nor more aware of how precarious happiness could be,” she wrote, adding of welcoming her son, “I survived preeclampsia, a life-threatening birth complication, and finally, our family was whole. Mine is a story of worrying in the wrong direction.”</p>



<p>While noting her knowledge as a psychologist of how challenging the postpartum period can be on a marriage, she continued, “But I confidently moved to another country with my 2-month-old baby and my husband to support his career. Consumed by the magic and mundanity of new motherhood, I didn’t understand the growing distance between us.”</p>



<p>Now, Jay noted how she’s looking to the future amid the public scrutiny on her life.</p>



<p>“I work diligently on my private project of accepting the sudden public downfall of my marriage,” she added. “This, I tell myself, is nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to hide. Slowly but surely, I have come to believe that in the absence of the life I planned with my high-school sweetheart, a lifetime of sweetness is waiting for me and my child.”</p>



<p>She also spoke to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411354/ethan-slaters-ex-lilly-jay-shares-update-on-coparenting-dynamic-after-their-split" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her current dynamic with Slater</a>. “While our partnership has changed, our parenthood has not,” she noted. “Both of us fiercely love our son 100 percent of the time, regardless of how our parenting time is divided.”</p>



<p>For his part, Slater has <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409298/ethan-slater-addresses-really-difficult-speculation-about-ariana-grande-relationship" target="_blank">previously spoken to the public backlash</a> his and Grande&#8217;s relationship garnered amid rumors of infidelity.</p>



<p>“I think there was something that was really difficult about things in your private life being commented on and looked at by the public,” he told <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> in October. “There were a lot of big changes in private lives that were really happening, so it’s really hard to see people who don’t know anything about what’s happening commenting on it.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile Grande has steadfastly <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1407959/ariana-grande-slams-rumors-about-ethan-slater-relationship" target="_blank">supported her partner’s character</a>.</p>



<p>“There couldn’t be a less accurate depiction of a human being than the one that the tabloids spread about him,” she told <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wicked-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-cover" target="_blank">Vanity Fair</a> in November. “No one on this earth tries harder or spreads themselves thinner to be there for the people that he loves and cares about.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>It’s official:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/video/-wicked-part-2-gets-name-change-before-the-2025-release-227260485920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Act 2 of “Wicked”</a>&nbsp;is coming next November, and it has a title.</p>



<p>The second and final installment of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/wicked-movie-musical-differences-rcna180806" target="_blank">“Wicked”</a>&nbsp;will be released Nov. 21, 2025, and it will be called “Wicked: For Good.”</p>







<p>The news came in a joint&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDpx-HQz151/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-wicked-relationship-rcna22767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo</a>, director&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/jon-m-chu-baby-wicked-premiere-rcna179492" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jon M. Chu</a>, and the movie’s Instagram page.</p>



<p>“You will be changed,” reads the caption.</p>



<p>The title of the second movie is of course a reference to an iconic song from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/wicked-debate-sing-in-theaters-rcna181342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the “Wicked” musical</a>, “For Good,” which is expected to be included on the sequel’s soundtrack.</p>



<p>“Wicked: For Good” will pick up after what would have been the intermission of the original Broadway musical.</p>



<p>Like in the stage musical, there will be a time jump, Bowen Yang, who plays Pfannee,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/wicked-part-two-spoilers-rcna181072" target="_blank">told TODAY.com</a>&nbsp;in November.</p>



<p>“Right when we pick up, Glinda is in this very front-facing position. Pfannee and Shenshen (Bronwyn James) are at her side still, but a lot is in motion,” he said. “The world has literally changed, and the landscape of it is very different. There is this campaign against this one person that they’re like the reason for all the problems in the world.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/nessarose-wicked-marissa-bode-interview-rcna180532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marissa Bode</a>, who plays Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose, also told TODAY.com that her character will play a bigger role in the second film.</p>



<p>“What was helpful to me was journaling as my character to fill in a lot of the blanks and to really get in the mindset (of) why my character changed, what her feelings were in the in between and how did she get to where she was today,” she said.</p>



<p>“Wicked”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/wicked-gladiator-ii-box-office-winner-rcna181542?search=wicked" target="_blank">premiered in theaters</a>&nbsp;Nov. 22, opening with $114 million at the domestic box office.

<p>“Bluey” is heading to the big screen. </p>



<p>The Walt Disney Co. and BBC Studios announced Tuesday that a film based on the hit Australian animated series will arrive in theaters in 2027. The movie will be written and directed by series creator Joe Brumm, with a voice cast led by the series&#8217; regulars, including Melanie Zanetti and David McCormack. </p>



<p>According to the companies, the CGI-animated film will “continue the adventures of Bluey, a lovable, inexhaustible, blue heeler dog, who lives with her Mum, Dad and her little sister, Bingo.” </p>



<p>“I’ve always thought ‘Bluey’ deserved a theatrical movie,” Brumm said in a statement. “I want this to be an experiential event for the whole family to enjoy together.”</p>



<p>After Brumm launched the Australian production in 2018, the series has grown into a worldwide sensation and was the most-watched series globally on Disney+ in 2024.</p>



<p>“Since its debut on Disney Jr. and Disney+, Bluey has become a global phenomenon, uniting families everywhere with its heartfelt stories of play, imagination and connection,” said Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, Disney Entertainment co-chairs.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Nobody puts baby in a corner, but they’re putting her in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Film Registry</a>.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apnews.com/television-69152a7de6e845e8989d40422d0de0f5" target="_blank">“Dirty Dancing,”</a>&nbsp;along with another 1980s culture-changer, “Beverly Hills Cop,” are entering the Library of Congress’ registry, part of an annual group of 25 announced Tuesday that spans 115 years of filmmaking.</p>



<p>“Dirty Dancing” from 1987 used the physicality and chemistry of&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-f85ef35d536846cf92266151bec0bfa1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Swayze</a>&nbsp;as Johnny Castle and&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/movie-review-real-pain-435857b9f4619a42fadbee4f000fe3f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Grey</a>&nbsp;as Frances “Baby” Houseman to charm generations of moviegoers, while also taking on issues like abortion, classism and antisemitism. In the climactic moment, Swayze defiantly declares, “Nobody puts baby in a corner” before taking Grey to dance to “(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life.”</p>



<p>1984’s “Beverly Hills Cop,” the first&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/hub/eddie-murphy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eddie Murphy</a>&nbsp;film in the registry, arguably made him the world’s biggest movie star at the time and made action comedies a blockbuster staple for a decade.</p>



<p>Since 1988, the Librarian of Congress has annually selected movies for preservation that are “culturally, historically or aesthetically” significant. The current picks bring the registry to 900 films. Turner Classic Movies will host a TV special on Wednesday, screening a selection of the class of 2024.</p>



<p>The oldest film is from 1895 and brought its own form of dirty dancing: “Annabelle Serpentine Dance” is a minute-long short of a shimmying Annabelle Moore that was decried by many as a public indecency for the suggestiveness of her moves. The newest is&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/killer-movie-review-david-fincher-michael-fassbender-4a1a2ae41c65635afb813d716ff73afa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Fincher’s</a>&nbsp;“The Social Network” from 2010.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">A look at some of the films entering the registry</h2>



<p><strong>“Pride of the Yankees” (1942): </strong>The film became the model for the modern sports tear-jerker, with Gary Cooper playing Lou Gehrig and delivering the classic real-life line: “Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.”</p>



<p><strong>“The Miracle Worker” (1962): </strong>Anne Bancroft won an Oscar for best actress for playing title character Anne Sullivan and 16-year-old Patty Duke won best supporting actress for playing her deaf and blind protege Helen Keller in director Arthur Penn’s film.</p>



<p><strong>“Up in Smoke” (1978): </strong>The first feature to star the duo of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong established a template for the stoner genre and brought weed culture to the mainstream. Marin, who also appears in the inductee “Spy Kids” from 2001, is one of many Latinos with prominent roles this year’s crop of films.</p>



<p><strong>“Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan” (1982):</strong> The second movie in the “Star Trek” franchise featured one of filmdom’s great villains in Ricardo Montalban’s Khan, and showed that the world of Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock could bring vital thrills to the cinema.</p>



<p><strong>“Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt” (1989): </strong>The Oscar-winning documentary on the NAMES Project Aids Memorial Quilt was a landmark telling of the devastation wrought by the disease.</p>



<p><strong>“My Own Private Idaho” (1991): </strong>Director Gus Van Sant’s film featured perhaps the greatest performance of River Phoenix, a year before the actor’s death at age 23.</p>



<p><strong>“American Me” (1992): </strong>Edward James Olmos starred and made his film directorial debut in this tale of Chicano gang life in Los Angeles and the brutal prison experience of its main character.</p>



<p><strong>“No Country for Old Men” (2007): </strong>Joel and Ethan Coen broke through at the Oscars with their adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s novel, winning best picture, best director and best adapted screenplay, while Javier Bardem won best supporting actor for playing a relentless killer with an unforgettable haircut.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1381502/ethan-slaters-estranged-wife-lilly-jay-slams-not-a-girls-girl-ariana-grande" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lilly Jay</a>’s life was thrust into the spotlight amid her split from <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411286/why-ariana-grande-is-singing-boyfriend-ethan-slaters-praises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan Slater</a>.</p>



<p>In a personal essay, the clinical psychologist got candid about the ways in which <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1407314/ariana-grandes-boyfriend-ethan-slater-finalizes-divorce-from-wife" target="_blank">her divorce from the Wicked actor</a> — with whom she shares a 2-year-old son — affected her personal life and career as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409738/inside-wicked-costars-ariana-grande-and-ethan-slaters-magical-romance" target="_blank">her former partner moved on with</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/ariana_grande" target="_blank">Ariana Grande</a>, though Jay doesn’t name either by name.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to measure an absence, and I can’t say for sure how much my career has been impacted by what’s out there online,” she wrote in <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/lilly-jay-divorce-essay-therapy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her essay for The Cut</a>, published Dec. 19. “But there have been hints along the way, like the job offer that dissolved without explanation after yet another tabloid news cycle or the patient who’s scheduled for a first appointment but seemingly vanishes.”</p>



<p>She added, “On my darker days, I railed against the unfairness of a public divorce, asking my therapist, ‘Who would trust a cardiologist who had a heart attack because they never got an EKG?’”</p>



<p>Jay — who had been with Slater since high school — also spoke to how she and her former partner had decided to navigate his rising star against her preference for anonymity as a psychologist.</p>



<p><b>READ</b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1381502/ethan-slaters-estranged-wife-lilly-jay-slams-not-a-girls-girl-ariana-grande" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ethan Slater&#8217;s Estranged Wife Lilly Jay Slams &#8220;Not a Girl&#8217;s Girl&#8221; Ariana Grande</a></p>



<p>“My partner was on a different path, in which social media and exposure were not impediments but rather necessities,” she wrote. “We puzzled through this predicament on walks, over pizza, in our apartment and excitedly concocted rules of engagement of how and what he would share about our lives together. It was a tenuous balance — my profession, which requires privacy, and his, which is measured in applause — but it worked well while life was unfolding according to our plans.”</p>



<p>Yet, Jay also spoke to the ways in which her plans did not turn out as she’d expected, including finalizing her divorce with her high school sweetheart in September, two years after welcoming their son in Aug. 2022.</p>



<p>“During my pregnancy, I had never felt happier nor more aware of how precarious happiness could be,” she wrote, adding of welcoming her son, “I survived preeclampsia, a life-threatening birth complication, and finally, our family was whole. Mine is a story of worrying in the wrong direction.”</p>



<p>While noting her knowledge as a psychologist of how challenging the postpartum period can be on a marriage, she continued, “But I confidently moved to another country with my 2-month-old baby and my husband to support his career. Consumed by the magic and mundanity of new motherhood, I didn’t understand the growing distance between us.”</p>



<p>Now, Jay noted how she’s looking to the future amid the public scrutiny on her life.</p>



<p>“I work diligently on my private project of accepting the sudden public downfall of my marriage,” she added. “This, I tell myself, is nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to hide. Slowly but surely, I have come to believe that in the absence of the life I planned with my high-school sweetheart, a lifetime of sweetness is waiting for me and my child.”</p>



<p>She also spoke to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411354/ethan-slaters-ex-lilly-jay-shares-update-on-coparenting-dynamic-after-their-split" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her current dynamic with Slater</a>. “While our partnership has changed, our parenthood has not,” she noted. “Both of us fiercely love our son 100 percent of the time, regardless of how our parenting time is divided.”</p>



<p>For his part, Slater has <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409298/ethan-slater-addresses-really-difficult-speculation-about-ariana-grande-relationship" target="_blank">previously spoken to the public backlash</a> his and Grande&#8217;s relationship garnered amid rumors of infidelity.</p>



<p>“I think there was something that was really difficult about things in your private life being commented on and looked at by the public,” he told <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> in October. “There were a lot of big changes in private lives that were really happening, so it’s really hard to see people who don’t know anything about what’s happening commenting on it.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile Grande has steadfastly <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1407959/ariana-grande-slams-rumors-about-ethan-slater-relationship" target="_blank">supported her partner’s character</a>.</p>



<p>“There couldn’t be a less accurate depiction of a human being than the one that the tabloids spread about him,” she told <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wicked-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-cover" target="_blank">Vanity Fair</a> in November. “No one on this earth tries harder or spreads themselves thinner to be there for the people that he loves and cares about.”</p>

<p>“I’m honored to be asked back and can’t wait to share the evening with my fellow actors, doing what we do best&#8230; celebrating ourselves,” Bell said in a statement Monday.

<p>In a personal essay, the clinical psychologist got candid about the ways in which <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1407314/ariana-grandes-boyfriend-ethan-slater-finalizes-divorce-from-wife" target="_blank">her divorce from the Wicked actor</a> — with whom she shares a 2-year-old son — affected her personal life and career as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409738/inside-wicked-costars-ariana-grande-and-ethan-slaters-magical-romance" target="_blank">her former partner moved on with</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/ariana_grande" target="_blank">Ariana Grande</a>, though Jay doesn’t name either by name.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to measure an absence, and I can’t say for sure how much my career has been impacted by what’s out there online,” she wrote in <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/lilly-jay-divorce-essay-therapy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her essay for The Cut</a>, published Dec. 19. “But there have been hints along the way, like the job offer that dissolved without explanation after yet another tabloid news cycle or the patient who’s scheduled for a first appointment but seemingly vanishes.”</p>



<p>She added, “On my darker days, I railed against the unfairness of a public divorce, asking my therapist, ‘Who would trust a cardiologist who had a heart attack because they never got an EKG?’”</p>



<p>Jay — who had been with Slater since high school — also spoke to how she and her former partner had decided to navigate his rising star against her preference for anonymity as a psychologist.</p>

<p>“My partner was on a different path, in which social media and exposure were not impediments but rather necessities,” she wrote. “We puzzled through this predicament on walks, over pizza, in our apartment and excitedly concocted rules of engagement of how and what he would share about our lives together. It was a tenuous balance — my profession, which requires privacy, and his, which is measured in applause — but it worked well while life was unfolding according to our plans.”</p>



<p>Yet, Jay also spoke to the ways in which her plans did not turn out as she’d expected, including finalizing her divorce with her high school sweetheart in September, two years after welcoming their son in Aug. 2022.</p>



<p>“During my pregnancy, I had never felt happier nor more aware of how precarious happiness could be,” she wrote, adding of welcoming her son, “I survived preeclampsia, a life-threatening birth complication, and finally, our family was whole. Mine is a story of worrying in the wrong direction.”</p>



<p>While noting her knowledge as a psychologist of how challenging the postpartum period can be on a marriage, she continued, “But I confidently moved to another country with my 2-month-old baby and my husband to support his career. Consumed by the magic and mundanity of new motherhood, I didn’t understand the growing distance between us.”</p>



<p>Now, Jay noted how she’s looking to the future amid the public scrutiny on her life.</p>



<p>“I work diligently on my private project of accepting the sudden public downfall of my marriage,” she added. “This, I tell myself, is nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to hide. Slowly but surely, I have come to believe that in the absence of the life I planned with my high-school sweetheart, a lifetime of sweetness is waiting for me and my child.”</p>



<p>She also spoke to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411354/ethan-slaters-ex-lilly-jay-shares-update-on-coparenting-dynamic-after-their-split" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her current dynamic with Slater</a>. “While our partnership has changed, our parenthood has not,” she noted. “Both of us fiercely love our son 100 percent of the time, regardless of how our parenting time is divided.”</p>



<p>For his part, Slater has <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409298/ethan-slater-addresses-really-difficult-speculation-about-ariana-grande-relationship" target="_blank">previously spoken to the public backlash</a> his and Grande&#8217;s relationship garnered amid rumors of infidelity.</p>



<p>“I think there was something that was really difficult about things in your private life being commented on and looked at by the public,” he told <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> in October. “There were a lot of big changes in private lives that were really happening, so it’s really hard to see people who don’t know anything about what’s happening commenting on it.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile Grande has steadfastly <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1407959/ariana-grande-slams-rumors-about-ethan-slater-relationship" target="_blank">supported her partner’s character</a>.</p>



<p>“There couldn’t be a less accurate depiction of a human being than the one that the tabloids spread about him,” she told <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wicked-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-cover" target="_blank">Vanity Fair</a> in November. “No one on this earth tries harder or spreads themselves thinner to be there for the people that he loves and cares about.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Popeye can punch without permission and Tintin can roam freely starting in 2025. The two classic comic characters who first appeared in 1929 are among the intellectual properties becoming public domain in the United States on Jan. 1. That means they can be used and repurposed without permission or payment to copyright holders. </p>



<p>This year’s crop of newly public artistic creations lacks the landmark vibes of last year’s entrance of into the public domain of <a href="https://ots.nbcwpshield.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/earliest-version-of-mickey-mouse-set-to-become-public-domain-in-2024-along-with-minnie-tigger/3219330/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mickey Mouse</a>. But they include a deep well of canonical works whose 95-year copyright maximums will expire. And the Disney icon&#8217;s public domain presence expands. </p>



<p>“It’s a trove! There are a dozen new Mickey cartoons — he speaks for the first time and dons the familiar white gloves,” said Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain. “There are masterpieces from Faulkner and Hemingway, the first sound films from Alfred Hitchcock, Cecil B. DeMille, and John Ford, and amazing music from Fats Waller, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. Pretty exciting!” </p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at this year’s crop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Comics characters loom large</h2>



<p>Popeye the Sailor, with his bulging forearms, mealy-mouthed speech, and propensity for fistfights, was created by E.C. Segar and made his first appearance in the newspaper strip “Thimble Theater” in 1929, speaking his first words, “’Ja think I’m a cowboy?” when asked if he was a sailor. What was supposed to be a one-off appearance became permanent, and the strip would be renamed ”Popeye.”</p>



<p>But as with Mickey Mouse last year and <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/pooh-sun-also-rises-among-works-going-public-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Winnie the Pooh</a> in 2022, only the earliest version is free for reuse. The spinach that gave the sailor his super-strength was not there from the start, and is the kind of character element that could spawn legal disputes. And the animated shorts featuring his distinctive mumbly voice didn’t begin until 1933 and remain under copyright. As does director Robert Altman’s 1980 film, starring Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelley Duvall as his oft-fought-over sweetheart Olive Oyl.</p>

<p>That movie was tepidly received initially. So was director Steven Spielberg’s “Adventures of Tintin” in 2011. But the comics about the boy reporter that inspired it, the creation of Belgian artist Hergé, were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century. </p>



<p>The simply drawn teen with dots for eyes and bangs like an ocean wave first appeared in a supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle, and became a weekly feature. </p>



<p>The comic also first appeared in the U.S. in 1929. Its signature bright colors — including Tintin’s red hair — didn’t appear until years later, and could, like Popeye’s spinach, be the subject of legal disputes. </p>



<p>And in much of the world, Tintin won’t become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Books show American lit at its height </h2>



<p>The books becoming public this year read like the syllabus for an American literature seminar.</p>



<p>“The Sound and the Fury,” arguably William Faulkner’s quintessential novel with its modernist stream-of-consciousness style, was a sensation after its publication despite being famously difficult for readers. It uses multiple non-linear narratives to tell the story of a prominent family’s ruin in the author’s native Mississippi, and would help lead to Faulkner’s Nobel Prize.</p>



<p>And Ernest Hemingway’s “A Farewell to Arms” joins his earlier “The Sun Also Rises” in the public domain. The partly autobiographical story of an ambulance driver in Italy during the First World War cemented Hemingway’s status in the American literary canon. It has been frequently adapted for film, TV and radio, which can now be done without permission.</p>



<p>John Steinbeck’s first novel, “A Cup of Gold,” from 1929, will also enter the public domain.</p>



<p>The British novelist Virginia Woolf’s “A Room of One’s Own,” an extended essay that would become a landmark in feminism from the modernist literary luminary, is also on the list. Her novel “Mrs. Dalloway” is already in the U.S. public domain. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Movie legends in the making</h2>



<p>While a host of truly major movies will become public in the coming decade, for now early works by major figures from the not-always-stellar early sound era will have to suffice.</p>



<p>A decade before he would move to Hollywood and make films like “Psycho,” and “Vertigo,” Alfred Hitchcock made “Blackmail” in Britain. The film was begun as a silent but shifted to sound during production, resulting in two different versions, one of them the UK’s — and Hitchcock’s — first sound film. </p>



<p>John Ford, whose later Westerns would put him among film’s most vaunted directors, also made his first foray into sound with 1929’s “The Black Watch,” an adventure epic that includes Ford’s future chief collaborator John Wayne as a young extra.</p>



<p>Cecil B. DeMille, already a Hollywood bigwig through silents, made his first talkie with the melodrama “Dynamite.”</p>



<p>Groucho, Harpo and the other Marx Brothers had their first starring movie roles in 1929’s “The Cocoanuts,” a forerunner to future classics like “Animal Crackers” and “Duck Soup.”</p>



<p>“The Broadway Melody,” the first sound film and the second film ever to win the Oscar for best picture — known as “outstanding production” at the time — will also become public, though it’s often ranked among the worst of best picture winners.</p>



<p>And after “Steamboat Willie” made the earliest Mickey Mouse public, a dozen more of his animations will get the same status, including “The Karnival Kid,” where he spoke for the first time. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Music rings out the 20s</h2>



<p>Songs from the last year of the Roaring Twenties are also about to become public property.</p>



<p>Cole Porter’s compositions “What Is This Thing Called Love?” and “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” are among the highlights, as is the jazz classic “Ain’t Misbehavin’, written by Fats Waller and Harry Brooks. </p>



<p>“Singin’ in the Rain,” which would later forever be associated with the 1952 Gene Kelly film, made its debut in the 1929 movie “The Hollywood Revue” and will now be public domain.</p>



<p>Different laws regulate sound recordings, and those newly in the public domain date to 1924. They include a recording of “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen” from future star and civil rights icon Marian Anderson, and “Rhapsody in Blue” performed by its composer George Gershwin.</p>

<p><strong>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411177/james-kennedy-returns-to-work-after-domestic-violence-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online</a></strong></p>



<p>James Kennedy is back behind his DJ booth.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/vanderpump_rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanderpump Rules</a> star returned to professionally performing on Dec. 14 at The Rave Eagles Club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, just four days <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411076/vanderpump-rules-james-kennedy-arrested-for-domestic-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">after he was arrested</a> for alleged <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/domestic_violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">domestic violence</a>.</p>



<p>“@itsjameskennedy turned up The Rave tonight,” the venue <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDlufZCx4vy/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to Instagram</a> in the early hours of Dec. 15. “Thanks to everyone who came out to party with us.”</p>



<p>The accompanying trio of photographs showed Kennedy at home in his DJ booth, all smiles as he performed for the crowd.</p>



<p>The DJ set comes shortly after Kennedy, whose real name is James Kennedy Georgiou, was arrested Dec. 10 in a home in Burbank, Calif., on a misdemeanor charge of domestic battery upon a spouse or cohabitant. The arrest came after an unidentified women inside stated &#8220;her boyfriend lifted her up and threw her to the ground,&#8221; according to an arrest log obtained by E! News.</p>



<p>Los Angeles jail records show that Kennedy was later released on a $20,000 bond.</p>

<p>Days after the 32-year-old’s arrest, his <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/1324175/vanderpump-rules-james-kennedy-makes-red-carpet-debut-with-girlfriend-ally-lewber?query=ally%2520lewber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">girlfriend of almost three years</a> Ally Lewber <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/1411169/james-kennedys-girlfriend-ally-lewber-breaks-silence-after-his-domestic-violence-arrest?query=james%2520kennedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a message with fans</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you to everyone who has reached out with love and support and for checking in on me,&#8221; the 28-year-old wrote on her Instagram Stories Dec. 14, marking her first public comments about the incident. &#8220;I&#8217;m okay and taking the time I need right now.”</p>



<p>She concluded, “I deeply appreciate all the kindness and respect for my privacy during this time.&#8221;</p>



<p>E! News reached out to reps for Kennedy and Lewber following his arrest for comment but has not heard back.</p>



<p>While most of Kenney’s VPR castmates have remained tight-lipped about his arrest — save for his ex <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1410445/vanderpump-rules-alum-kristen-doute-is-pregnant-expecting-baby-with-fiance-luke-broderick" target="_blank">Kristen Doute</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.eonline.com/news/1411092/james-kennedys-ex-kristen-doute-reacts-to-the-vanderpump-rules-stars-arrest?query=james%2520kennedy" target="_blank">who wrote, “Finally,”</a> alongside an article detailing his arrest on her Instagram Story — <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.eonline.com/news/1411120/james-kennedys-attorneys-address-domestic-violence-allegations-after-his-arrest?query=james%2520kennedy" target="_blank">Kennedy’s legal team spoke out</a> in his defense.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are in the process of conducting our own investigation into the allegations levied by the Burbank Police Department against James,&#8221; his attorneys said in a statement obtained by E! News Dec. 13. &#8220;We understand that there were no injuries and we are hoping that, after careful review, the city’s attorneys will decide not to file formal charges.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hours before his arrest, Kennedy and Lewber — who appeared on Vanderpump Rules with her boyfriend — had attended <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/kathy_hilton" target="_blank">Kathy Hilton</a>&#8216;s DIRECTV holiday party in Beverly Hills together.</p>



<p>The day after the DJ’s arrest, Lewber stepped out in Los Angeles to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411105/what-james-kennedys-girlfriend-ally-lewber-did-one-day-after-his-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">host the holiday party</a> for fashion brand Windsor where she showed nothing but smiles as she posed for photos.</p>



<p>Kennedy’s legal troubles come shortly after Bravo announced they’d be <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/1410454/vanderpump-rules-shakes-up-season-12-with-brand-new-cast?query=vanderpump%2520rules%2520cast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">casting an entire new group</a> of people for the upcoming season of Vanderpump Rules, saying goodbye to almost all its <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/1410474/vanderpump-rules-ariana-madix-lala-kent-and-more-react-to-season-12-cast-shake-up?query=vanderpump%2520rules%2520cast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original and longtime cast members</a>, including Kennedy.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s been a wild ride and I’m excited to see what the future holds,&#8221; Kennedy wrote on Instagram Nov. 26. &#8220;Although this is a bittersweet ending, for me, this is just the beginning! THANK YOU.&#8221;</p>

<p>Look-a-like contests are relatively popular lately but, they can seem kind of same-y. </p>



<p>On Sunday, there was a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/pennsauken-man-wins-jalen-hurts-look-a-like-contest-in-rittenhouse-square/4054801/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/pennsauken-man-wins-jalen-hurts-look-a-like-contest-in-rittenhouse-square/4054801/" target="_blank">Jalen Hurts look-alike contest </a>and last month, Philadelphia residents battled it out for who looked <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/the-scene/miles-teller-doppelgangers-take-over-philly-square-with-cheesesteak-on-the-line/4037641/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/the-scene/miles-teller-doppelgangers-take-over-philly-square-with-cheesesteak-on-the-line/4037641/" target="_blank">most like the actor Miles Teller</a>. </p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">
<p>But, on Saturday in Rittenhouse Square, there was a contest that took look-alike competitions to new heights &#8212; a Jason Kelce look-alike contest. </p>
</div>





<p>When the Kelce doppelgangers gathered and all was said and done, Fishtown&#8217;s Paul Crossley took home the title as the best Jason Kelce.</p>



<p>It was a title he didn&#8217;t take lightly. </p>



<p>&#8220;Very tough competition. You know, a lot of guys looked exactly like me, to be honest out here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was kind of freaky. But, everyone came up and had a good time and here we are. We all pulled together, all of us Jasons and they were great. They were great competitors.&#8221;</p>



<p>Crossley won Bird Gang liquor for his ability to look like the retired football player. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Zakir Hussain, one of <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/india" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">India&#8217;s</a> most accomplished classical musicians who defied genres and introduced tabla to global audiences, died on Sunday. He was 73.</p>



<p>The Indian classical music icon died from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic lung disease, at a hospital in San Francisco, his family said in a statement.</p>



<p>“His prolific work as a teacher, mentor and educator has left an indelible mark on countless musicians. He hoped to inspire the next generation to go further. He leaves behind an unparalleled legacy as a cultural ambassador and one of the greatest musicians of all time,” the statement read.</p>



<p>Hussain was the most recognizable exponent of tabla, a pair of hand drums that is the main percussion instrument in Indian classical music.</p>



<p>Considered the greatest tabla player of his generation, Hussain had a career that spanned six decades in which he collaborated with the likes of singer-songwriter George Harrison, jazz saxophonist Charles Lloyd, drummer Mickey Hart and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. </p>



<p>The son of legendary tabla artist Alla Rakha, Hussain was born in 1951 in Mumbai and was taught how to play the instrument by his father at the age of 7. A child prodigy, he was touring by age 12 and performing alongside India’s classical music legends during his teens.</p>



<p>In an interview that was shared widely on social media in India, Hussain says his father welcomed him into the world after he was born by speaking tabla rhythms into his ears.</p>



<p>“I was brought home, handed over to my dad in his arms. The tradition was that the father is supposed to recite a prayer in the baby’s ear &#8230; So he takes me in his arms, puts his lips to my ear and recites the tabla rhythms into my ears,” Hussain says in the interview, verbally imitating the rhythmic pattern of the instrument.</p>



<p>Both Alla Rakha and Hussain were given the honorific “Ustad,” an Urdu word that means master.</p>



<p>In 1973, Hussain formed the Indian jazz fusion band “Shakti” with jazz guitarist John McLaughlin. The band played acoustic fusion music that combined Indian music with elements of jazz, introducing a new sound to Western audiences.</p>



<p>In 2024, Hussain became the first musician from India to win three Grammy awards in the same year.</p>



<p>Hussain’s “Shakti” won Best Global Music Album, and his collaboration with Edgar Meyer, Béla Fleck and flutist Rakesh Chaurasia won Best Global Music Performance and Best Contemporary Instrumental Album. He had earlier won a Grammy in 2009.</p>



<p>In 2023, Hussain received the Padma Vibhushan, India’s second-highest civilian award.</p>



<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Hussain a “true genius who revolutionized the world of Indian classical music” and “an icon of cultural unity.”</p>



<p>“He also brought the tabla to the global stage, captivating millions with his unparalleled rhythm,” <a href="https://x.com/narendramodi/status/1868544110367560025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modi wrote in a post on social platform X</a>.</p>



<p>Hussain is survived by his wife and two daughters.</p>

<p>Sarah Michelle Gellar says she might be willing to pick up the vampire stake again for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/sarah-michelle-gellar-dolly-parton-buffy-producer-rcna68682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&#8221;</a>&nbsp;reboot.</p>



<p>During a recent appearance on &#8220;The Drew Barrymore Show,&#8221; Gellar, 47, revealed that she would consider&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/popculture/sarah-michelle-gellar-honors-buffy-s-40th-birthday-message-be-t206156" target="_blank">reprising the role of Buffy Summers</a>&nbsp;— reversing her earlier position to leave the &#8220;Buffy&#8221; universe in her acting past.</p>



<p>Gellar explained that she changed her stance after watching other successful recent reboots, including the &#8220;Sex and the City&#8221; revival &#8220;And Just Like That&#8230;&#8221; and the &#8220;Dexter&#8221; prequel &#8220;Dexter: Original Sin,&#8221; which counts her as a cast member.</p>







<p>“It’s funny. I always used to say no, because (&#8216;Buffy&#8217;) in its bubble and it’s so perfect,” Gellar explained. “But watching ‘Sex and the City’ and seeing ‘Dexter,’ and realizing there are ways to do it, definitely does get your mind thinking, ‘Well, maybe.’”</p>



<p>Gellar appeared on Barrymore&#8217;s show alongside her &#8220;Dexter: Original Sin&#8221; co-star Christian Slater. When Slater pointed out that a &#8220;Buffy&#8221; reboot didn&#8217;t need to be a prequel like their show, Gellar agreed.</p>



<p>“It could be anything,” Gellar said. “It’s a universe. It makes you realize that in this world, we need those heroes, I think, more so than ever.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&#8221; aired from 1997 to 2003 and told the story of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/popculture/sarah-michelle-gellar-wears-buffy-vampire-slayer-prom-dress-23-t181062" target="_blank">a teenage girl in California</a>&nbsp;whose destiny was fighting vampires and other monsters to ultimately save the world. The show was based on the 1992 “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” movie, which starred Kristy Swanson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the on-air segment, Barrymore revealed that she auditioned to play Buffy in the 1992 film.</p>



<p>Gellar then interjected, &#8220;And you know the famous line from the movie: &#8216;All I want to do is graduate high school, go to Europe, marry Christian Slater and die.'&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And here we are!&#8221; added Barrymore as audience members laughed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, we keep living,&#8221; said a grinning Slater, &#8220;which is good.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The Spider-Man spinoff “Kraven the Hunter” got off to a disastrous start in North American theaters this weekend. </p>



<p>The movie starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson earned only $11 million, according to studio estimates Sunday, making it one of the worst openings for a Marvel-adjacent property. Its box office take was even less than the film “Madame Web.&#8221;</p>



<p>The weekend&#8217;s other major studio release was Warner Bros.’ animated “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,” which made $4.6 million. Made for about $30 million, the movie is set 183 years before the events of “The Lord of the Rings” films and was fast-tracked to ensure New Line did not lose the rights to Tolkien’s novels. Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have been working on future live-action films for the franchise.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the top of the charts again belonged to “Moana 2&#8243; and “Wicked.”</p>



<p>“Moana” added $26.6 million to its domestic total in its third weekend and $57.2 million internationally, bringing its global tally to $717 million. It&#8217;s now the fourth highest grossing film of the year, surpassing “Dune: Part Two.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Wicked,” which is in its fourth weekend, brought in another $22.5 million to take second place. The Universal musical has made over $359 million domestically and over $500 million worldwide. </p>



<p>“Gladiator II” also made $7.8 million, bringing its domestic total to $145.9 million in four weeks. </p>



<p>“Kraven the Hunter” is the latest misfire from Sony in its attempt to mine the Spider-Man universe for spin-off franchises without the lucrative web slinger himself. “Kraven” joins “Madame Web” and “Morbius” in franchise additions that fell flat with both audiences and critics. The one exception on this rollercoaster journey has been the “Venom” trilogy, which has made over $1.8 billion worldwide. </p>



<p>The R-rated “Kraven the Hunter” was directed by J.C. Chandor and faced a number of delays, partly due to the Hollywood strikes. It was shot nearly three years ago and originally slated to hit theaters in January 2023. The film cost a reported $110 million to produce and was co-financed by TSG. Internationally, it made $15 million, but its potential for longevity appears limited: It currently carries a 15% “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes and got a C grade on CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences.</p>



<p>“It’s not always a guarantee that you’ll be able to connect with audiences when you have a spinoff character,&#8221; said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “General audiences seem to want to know exactly what they’re getting.”</p>



<p>Several awards contenders opened in limited release over the weekend, including Paramount’s “September 5” about ABC&#8217;s coverage of the Munich Olympics hostage crisis. Amazon MGM and Orion&#8217;s “Nickel Boys,” based on Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer-winner about an abusive reform school in Florida, opened in two theaters in New York. It averaged $30,422 per screen and will be expanding to Los Angeles before going nationwide in the coming weeks. </p>



<p>Some big hitters are on the way in the home stretch of the 2024 box office. “Mufasa” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” will hit in the coming weeks along with a bevy of arthouse and adult releases like “Babygirl,” “Nosferatu” and “A Complete Unknown.&#8221;</p>



<p>The box office has seen a dramatic recovery since June, when it was down nearly 28% from the previous year. The deficit now stands at 4.8%. </p>



<p>Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: </p>



<p>1. “Moana 2,&#8221; $26.6 million.</p>



<p>2. “Wicked,” $22.5 million.</p>



<p>3. “Kraven the Hunter,” $11 million.</p>



<p>4. “Gladiator II,” $7.8 million.</p>



<p>5. “Red One,” $4.6 million.</p>



<p>6. “Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,” $4.5 million.</p>



<p>7. “Interstellar” (rerelease), $3.3 million.</p>



<p>8. “Pushpa: The Rule — Part 2,” $1.6 million.</p>



<p>9. “The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,” $1.4 million.</p>



<p>10. “Queer,&#8221; $790,954.</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s host of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/saturday-night-live" target="_blank">&#8220;Saturday Night Live,&#8221;</a> Chris Rock, didn&#8217;t mince words during his monologue about YouTuber Jake Paul, who recently fought boxing legend Mike Tyson in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/netflix" target="_blank">Netflix</a> live event.</p>



<p>Rock, who was part of the &#8220;SNL&#8221; cast in the early 1990s, said during his monologue that &#8220;it has not been good for my people&#8230; Blacks.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not been a good year. Kamala. Diddy. Jake Paul beating Mike Tyson,&#8221; Rock said. &#8220;Who is this Jake Paul? A 27-year-old punching a 60-year-old man in the face. Is this what the white man has reduced himself to? Stop it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s next? Morgan Freeman?&#8221; Rock added jokingly. &#8220;I hate Jake Paul. I hate him like cocaine hates monogamy.&#8221; </p>



<p>Paul, a popular YouTuber and brother of fellow YouTuber Logan Paul, <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/who-won-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defeated &#8220;The Hangover&#8221; star</a> after eight rounds in the ring last month. Tyson, who retired from boxing in 2005, came out of retirement for the fight that ultimately garnered more than <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/money-report/mike-tyson-jake-paul-fight-was-the-most-streamed-sporting-event-ever-netflix-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100 million global viewers</a> on Netflix. </p>

<p><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411169/james-kennedys-girlfriend-ally-lewber-breaks-silence-after-his-domestic-violence-arrest">E! Online</a></em></p>



<p>James Kennedy&#8217;s <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1324175/vanderpump-rules-james-kennedy-makes-red-carpet-debut-with-girlfriend-ally-lewber" target="_blank">girlfriend</a> is speaking out after his <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/vanderpump-rules-star-james-kennedy-arrested-on-domestic-violence-charge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrest for alleged domestic violence</a>.</p>



<p>Ally Lewber, who has been dating the &#8220;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/vanderpump_rules" target="_blank">Vanderpump Rules</a>&#8221; cast member for almost three years, shared a message of gratitude to fans days after the reality star was detained in police custody.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you to everyone who has reached out with love and support and for checking in on me,&#8221; the 28-year-old wrote on her Instagram Stories Dec. 14, marking her first public comments about the incident. &#8220;I&#8217;m okay and taking the time I need right now. I deeply appreciate all the kindness and respect for my privacy during this time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kennedy, whose real name is James Kennedy Georgiou, was arrested Dec. 10 in a home in Burbank, Calif., on a misdemeanor charge of domestic battery upon a spouse or cohabitant after an unidentified women inside stated &#8220;her boyfriend lifted her up and threw her to the ground,&#8221; according to an arrest log obtained by E! News.</p>



<p>The 32-year-old was later released on a $20,000 bond, Los Angeles jail records show.</p>



<p>Following the arrest, the Bravolebrity&#8217;s legal team spoke out in his defense.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are in the process of conducting our own investigation into the allegations levied by the Burbank Police Department against James,&#8221; <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411120/james-kennedys-attorneys-address-domestic-violence-allegations-after-his-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kennedy&#8217;s attorneys said in a statement</a> obtained by E! News Dec. 13. &#8220;We understand that there were no injuries and we are hoping that, after careful review, the city’s attorneys will decide not to file formal charges.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hours before his arrest, Kennedy had attended <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/kathy_hilton" target="_blank">Kathy Hilton</a>&#8216;s DIRECTV holiday party in Beverly Hills with Lewber, who appears with him on &#8220;Vanderpump Rules.&#8221;</p>



<p>The day after the alleged domestic violence incident, she stepped out elsewhere in the Los Angeles area to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411105/what-james-kennedys-girlfriend-ally-lewber-did-one-day-after-his-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">host fashion brand Windsor&#8217;s holiday party</a>, and was all smiles while posing for pics.</p>



<p>The arrest comes weeks after <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1410636/andy-cohen-breaks-silence-on-vanderpump-rules-shocking-cast-reboot?query=vanderpump%2520rules" target="_blank">Bravo announced a &#8220;Vanderpump Rules&#8221; cast</a> shakeup — the cable network plans to replace the current stars with a new batch of SUR-vers for its upcoming 12th season.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s been a wild ride and I’m excited to see what the future holds,&#8221; Kennedy wrote on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> Nov. 26. &#8220;Although this is a bittersweet ending, for me, this is just the beginning! THANK YOU.&#8221;</p>

<p>For Patrick Tomasso, a 6 a.m. international flight and a roughly 350-mile journey was a small price to pay to see one of <a href="http://tag/movies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his favorite movies</a>, “Interstellar,” on the big screen again.</p>



<p>The Toronto-based cinematographer and film influencer said he’s seen Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi epic dozens of times since it debuted a decade ago. But when Paramount Pictures, the film’s distributor, announced it would be rereleased on select screens, Tomasso knew he’d do anything to secure a ticket. Even if it meant taking a very quick trip across the border to New York to see it at the closest theater with an IMAX screening available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Look what everyone did for Taylor Swift,” Tomasso said, referring to the hoards of fans who traveled the world to catch the pop star’s recent&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/end-era-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-coming-close-vancouver-rcna183279" target="_blank">record-breaking global tour</a>. “This is my Eras Tour.”</p>

<p>“Interstellar,” set in a futuristic Earth that’s becoming no longer habitable, follows farmer/ex-NASA pilot Joseph Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) as he and a team search for a new planet for humans. The Oscar-nominated film was a commercial hit at the time of its 2014 release, making more than $730 million at the global box office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the film&#8217;s limited rerelease is giving it another boost. It generated $4.5 million across 166 screens last weekend, with all IMAX screenings selling out. On some secondary markets online, tickets were listed for up to $215 per seat, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/interstellar-rerelease-box-office-success-old-movies-in-theaters-1236245101/" target="_blank">according to Variety</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While rereleasing a film in theaters is not new, the renewed success of “Interstellar” reflects a growing trend among audiences and distributors alike for these kinds of events. Many smaller theaters often run films in rerelease to help fill seats. In the aftermath of dueling Hollywood strikes, as well as the pandemic prior to that, studios and exhibitors leaned into a similar strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At least 27 legacy films were rereleased in 2024 into more than 100 domestic theaters — in many cases, more than 1,000 — grossing more than $90 million in total,” according to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/interstellar-rerelease-box-office-success-old-movies-in-theaters-1236245101/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>&nbsp;report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among the most notable examples was “Coraline,” a stop-motion animated dark fantasy horror film that grossed $53 million during its rerelease this summer. It was so successful in its rerelease that it&nbsp;<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/coraline-halloween-theater-return-rerelease-1236168317/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returned to theaters for a third time</a>&nbsp;on Halloween in newly remastered 3D and 2D formats.</p>

<p>The rerelease of “Interstellar” is tied to its 10th anniversary. After the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/live-blog/oscars-2024-live-updates-rcna141694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">success of Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” at the 2024 Academy Awards</a>, Paramount Pictures announced the theatrical rerelease of the film in April during CinemaCon, an annual film industry conference. Warner Bros. Pictures, which co-produced the movie, worked alongside Paramount for the revival, Variety&nbsp;<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/christopher-nolan-interstellar-10th-anniversary-rerelease-delayed-70mm-prints-1236098730/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously reported</a>.</p>



<p>The news immediately drew excitement, particularly among Nolan’s fervent fans who have long admired his dedication to prioritizing the theatrical experience. His 2008 “The Dark Knight” was lauded for being among the first studio films to be<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/movies/how-the-dark-knight-rises-makes-use-of-imax.html" target="_blank">&nbsp;shot partially using IMAX cameras.</a></p>



<p>Some moviegoers, like Natalie Fernandez, missed seeing “Interstellar” in theaters the first time around. The Miami-based research coordinator said she had always hoped to see it in IMAX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A friend told me I can’t experience it on a TV screen or a laptop screen,” said Fernandez, who documented her first time seeing it in IMAX last weekend with a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@msnatmarie/video/7446952972396940590?_r=1&amp;_t=8sC4Hg9cxmo" target="_blank">video on TikTok</a>. “It just does not compare.”</p>



<p>The text over her video read, “not to be dramatic but watching Interstellar in IMAX is a life-changing experience.” In her caption, she elaborated, “the tears never stopped, i fear no other movie will EVER top this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a recent interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/christopher-nolan-interstellar-rerelease-interview-bd7f4de84525062fb0d0e89a7fe6ea92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Associated Press</a>, Nolan said he was &#8220;so gratified by the response.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s really thrilling when people respond to your work at any point,” he told the publication. “But 10 years later, to have new audiences coming and experiencing it in the way that we’d originally intended it on the big IMAX screens and in particular on those IMAX film prints? It’s really rewarding to see that it continues to have a life.”</p>



<p>Tomasso, the avid moviegoer, said he already has tickets for the rerelease of David Fincher’s 1995 film, “Se7en,” which is&nbsp;<a href="https://collider.com/seven-4k-theatrical-re-release-blu-ray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slated to return in January around its 30th anniversary</a>.</p>



<p>When asked why he thinks rereleases are becoming so popular, Tomasso said “the theater is one of our last religious experiences where we can sit down in a dark room, nothing else matters for those two hours.”</p>



<p>“I really hope we can hang onto that,” he added.</p>

<p>King then staggers backwards in shock, tosses her purse on a nearby table and puts her hands on her chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;My bestie of 50 years is turning 70 so we gathered everyone that loved her to celebrate,&#8221; Winfrey captioned the post. &#8220;Hard thing to surprise her, O the stories we have made up, the lies we have told to keep this a secret.

<p>King later explained how the stunt was pulled off. &#8220;Talk about a surprise !!!&#8221; she wrote on her <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDkjhVvSv0r/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> page. &#8220;I thought I was going to @oprah’s holiday dinner for the @oprahdaily team at her favorite restaurant @cisiamonyc and then THIS happened ….&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Actor and singer Jamie Foxx </a>received stitches after he was hurt in an incident while celebrating his birthday at Mr. Chow in Beverly Hills, his spokesperson said Saturday.</p>



<p>The Grammy-winning singer was struck in the mouth after an individual from another table threw a glass, his spokesperson said. He is now recovering from the injury.</p>



<p>“The police were called and the matter is now in law enforcement’s hands,” the spokesperson said.</p>



<p>The Beverly Hills Police Department said it responded to a call of a possible assault with a deadly weapon at the high-end restaurant at about 10 p.m. Friday.</p>



<p>“Upon investigation, officers determined that the reported assault with a deadly weapon was unfounded,” the department said in a statement. “Instead, the incident involved a physical altercation between parties.”</p>



<p>On Sunday, Foxx seemingly addressed the incident, saying he was, &#8220;too blessed to be stressed.&#8221;</p>







<p>Details on what led up to the incident were not disclosed. No arrests were made in connection with the assault.</p>

<p>Ilona Maher is so proud of her<a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/ilona-maher-sports-illustrated-rcna168605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit&nbsp;</a>issue photos, she displays one of them on her smartphone.</p>



<p>The <a href="http://tag/sports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Olympic rugby player</a> addressed the image on her phone&#8217;s PopSocket (a phone-gripping disc that can go on the back of the device) Dec. 13 in a selfie video&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDhdyHbP__O/?hl=en" target="_blank">on Instagram</a>, explaining that she showcases one of the images from the special Sports Illustrated edition because she&#8217;s proud of the way she looks in it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, this is me,&#8221; she said, nodding while holding up her phone. &#8220;This is a photo of me from my SI Swim photoshoot and I look amazing.&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;Is it maybe a little self-absorbed to have this on the back of my phone?&#8221; she continued, laughing. &#8220;Maybe. Maybe it is. But when you look this good, it&#8217;s good to just keep looking at it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The athlete, who&#8217;s become as known for her sense of humor as her skill on the field, went on.</p>



<p>&#8220;Like you have a bad day, you&#8217;re like, &#8216;Aww, I&#8217;m not feeling too good.&#8217; Then, BAM! Take a look at that. Look at her. She&#8217;s so pretty,&#8221; she said, holding the image of herself closer to the camera.</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;m not ashamed,&#8221; she said, adding, &#8220;And if I ever lose my phone, people are going to know whose phone it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>“Yes, I like to look at myself,” the Olympic rugby player captioned her video.</p>



<p>Maher appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue in August 2024 shortly after she led&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/news/paris-olympics/us-women-win-first-olympic-medal-rugby-sevens-rcna164336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team USA to its first Olympic medal in rugby sevens</a>&nbsp;at the Paris Games.</p>



<p>In the cover image, she appears standing on a dock wearing a black bikini with her hands behind her head. More images of Maher wearing a royal blue string bikini appeared inside the publication.</p>

ILONA MAHER, ALAN BERSTEN</figcaption></figure>



<p>For the issue, Maher also talked to SI about how rugby gave her confidence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I love that (rugby) showed me what I can do,” Maher told the publication. “It showed me how capable my body is and it’s not just like a tool to be looked at and objectified.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-nbc-html-block html-block"><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ilonamaher/video/7390092986396233002" data-video-id="7390092986396233002" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@ilonamaher" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ilonamaher?refer=embed" rel="noopener">@ilonamaher</a> <p>As long as haters keep saying dumb stuff, I’m gonna keep clapping back</p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Ilona Maher" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7390093014037515054?refer=embed" rel="noopener">♬ original sound &#8211; Ilona Maher</a> </section> </blockquote> </div>



<p>Maher became a standout athlete at the <a href="http://tag/2024-paris-olympics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paris Olympics</a> thanks to her hilarious social media videos that displayed her wit and intelligence as well as her positive messages about body confidence.</p>



<p>In one viral TikTok video, Maher&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/mind-body/ilona-maher-weight-bmi-rcna164081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clapped back at a commenter</a>&nbsp;who wrote that she had a body mass index (BMI) of 30.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think you were trying to roast me, but this actually is a fact. I do have a BMI of 30 — well, 29.3 to be more exact,” Maher said in the video. “I’ve been considered overweight my whole life.”</p>



<p>Maher noted that she was 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 200 pounds, the only two measurements used to calculate BMI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I chatted with my dietitian because I go off of facts and not just what pops up (in my head) like you do,” she told the troll in the video. “We talked about how (BMI) really isn’t helpful for athletes.”</p>



<p>“BMI doesn’t really tell you what I can do. It doesn’t tell you what I do on the field, how fit I am,” Maher continued. “It’s just a couple numbers put together. It doesn’t tell you how much muscle I have or anything like that.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;So yeah, I do have a BMI of 30. I am considered overweight,&#8221; she added. &#8220;But alas, I’m going to the Olympics and you’re not.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Kelly Clarkson is relieved to know that Simone Biles is just like us.</p>



<p>On &#8220;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDfVf8BPJA9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>,&#8221; Biles who is known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/news/paris-olympics/simone-biles-most-decorated-american-olympic-gymnast-rcna164342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greatest gymnast of all time</a>, revealed why she posted an Instagram story in early December about not liking Pilates.</p>



<p>In the story, Biles said that this was her &#8220;first time working out since the Olympics&#8221; in August and she found the exercise to be &#8220;too hard.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I hear that we have something in common,&#8221;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/health/kelly-clarkson-weight-loss-rcna131969" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson said</a>&nbsp;on the Dec. 12, episode of her show, adding that she doesn&#8217;t like Pilates either.</p>



<p>The talk show host explained that she thought the class was more difficult in New York than in L.A. However, Biles said that she didn&#8217;t think that was necessarily true.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s everywhere because I cannot do it to save my life,&#8221; she said with a laugh.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so hard,&#8221; Clarkson replied. &#8220;My legs were trembling.&#8221;</p>



<p>Biles agreed and said the workout put her legs through the wringer as well. That&#8217;s why she took every opportunity to rest during class.</p>



<p>&#8220;My legs were trembling and when the teacher wasn&#8217;t looking, I was cheating,&#8221; she laughed.</p>



<p>“It’s not for me,&#8221; Biles added.</p>







<p>Clarkson said she did the same thing and to hear an athlete like Biles also struggled doing Pilates made her feel better about herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;It made me feel good that you weren&#8217;t good,&#8221; Clarkson said. &#8220;It made me feel better about myself. I was like, she&#8217;s an Olympic gold medalist. She&#8217;s the GOAT. She can&#8217;t do it, neither can I.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411357/ethan-slaters-ex-lilly-jay-addresses-unfairness-of-public-divorce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online</a></strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1381502/ethan-slaters-estranged-wife-lilly-jay-slams-not-a-girls-girl-ariana-grande" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lilly Jay</a>’s life was thrust into the spotlight amid her split from <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411286/why-ariana-grande-is-singing-boyfriend-ethan-slaters-praises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan Slater</a>.</p>



<p>In a personal essay, the clinical psychologist got candid about the ways in which <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1407314/ariana-grandes-boyfriend-ethan-slater-finalizes-divorce-from-wife" target="_blank">her divorce from the Wicked actor</a> — with whom she shares a 2-year-old son — affected her personal life and career as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409738/inside-wicked-costars-ariana-grande-and-ethan-slaters-magical-romance" target="_blank">her former partner moved on with</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/ariana_grande" target="_blank">Ariana Grande</a>, though Jay doesn’t name either by name.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to measure an absence, and I can’t say for sure how much my career has been impacted by what’s out there online,” she wrote in <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/lilly-jay-divorce-essay-therapy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her essay for The Cut</a>, published Dec. 19. “But there have been hints along the way, like the job offer that dissolved without explanation after yet another tabloid news cycle or the patient who’s scheduled for a first appointment but seemingly vanishes.”</p>



<p>She added, “On my darker days, I railed against the unfairness of a public divorce, asking my therapist, ‘Who would trust a cardiologist who had a heart attack because they never got an EKG?’”</p>



<p>Jay — who had been with Slater since high school — also spoke to how she and her former partner had decided to navigate his rising star against her preference for anonymity as a psychologist.</p>



<p><b>READ</b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1381502/ethan-slaters-estranged-wife-lilly-jay-slams-not-a-girls-girl-ariana-grande" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ethan Slater&#8217;s Estranged Wife Lilly Jay Slams &#8220;Not a Girl&#8217;s Girl&#8221; Ariana Grande</a></p>



<p>“My partner was on a different path, in which social media and exposure were not impediments but rather necessities,” she wrote. “We puzzled through this predicament on walks, over pizza, in our apartment and excitedly concocted rules of engagement of how and what he would share about our lives together. It was a tenuous balance — my profession, which requires privacy, and his, which is measured in applause — but it worked well while life was unfolding according to our plans.”</p>



<p>Yet, Jay also spoke to the ways in which her plans did not turn out as she’d expected, including finalizing her divorce with her high school sweetheart in September, two years after welcoming their son in Aug. 2022.</p>



<p>“During my pregnancy, I had never felt happier nor more aware of how precarious happiness could be,” she wrote, adding of welcoming her son, “I survived preeclampsia, a life-threatening birth complication, and finally, our family was whole. Mine is a story of worrying in the wrong direction.”</p>



<p>While noting her knowledge as a psychologist of how challenging the postpartum period can be on a marriage, she continued, “But I confidently moved to another country with my 2-month-old baby and my husband to support his career. Consumed by the magic and mundanity of new motherhood, I didn’t understand the growing distance between us.”</p>



<p>Now, Jay noted how she’s looking to the future amid the public scrutiny on her life.</p>



<p>“I work diligently on my private project of accepting the sudden public downfall of my marriage,” she added. “This, I tell myself, is nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to hide. Slowly but surely, I have come to believe that in the absence of the life I planned with my high-school sweetheart, a lifetime of sweetness is waiting for me and my child.”</p>



<p>She also spoke to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411354/ethan-slaters-ex-lilly-jay-shares-update-on-coparenting-dynamic-after-their-split" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her current dynamic with Slater</a>. “While our partnership has changed, our parenthood has not,” she noted. “Both of us fiercely love our son 100 percent of the time, regardless of how our parenting time is divided.”</p>



<p>For his part, Slater has <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409298/ethan-slater-addresses-really-difficult-speculation-about-ariana-grande-relationship" target="_blank">previously spoken to the public backlash</a> his and Grande&#8217;s relationship garnered amid rumors of infidelity.</p>



<p>“I think there was something that was really difficult about things in your private life being commented on and looked at by the public,” he told <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> in October. “There were a lot of big changes in private lives that were really happening, so it’s really hard to see people who don’t know anything about what’s happening commenting on it.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile Grande has steadfastly <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1407959/ariana-grande-slams-rumors-about-ethan-slater-relationship" target="_blank">supported her partner’s character</a>.</p>



<p>“There couldn’t be a less accurate depiction of a human being than the one that the tabloids spread about him,” she told <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wicked-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-cover" target="_blank">Vanity Fair</a> in November. “No one on this earth tries harder or spreads themselves thinner to be there for the people that he loves and cares about.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p><em>Originally appeared on <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411162/timothee-chalamet-looks-nearly-unrecognizable-with-blonde-bangs-on-red-carpet">E! Online</a></em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/timothee_chalamet">Timothée Chalamet</a> is going for a complete makeover.</p>



<p>The actor’s signature dark curls were nowhere to be seen as he arrived at the New York City premiere of &#8220;A Complete Unknown&#8221; — in which he portrays Bob Dylan — sporting a set of blonde bangs underneath a blue beanie hat.</p>



<p>In addition to the bangin’ new hairdo — which he paired with a thin mustache and goatee — the 28-year-old donned an oversized gray scarf over a red-and-blue plaid shirt and black leather jacket for the Dec. 13 appearance.</p>



<p>Chalamet&#8217;s transformation appears to be a direct nod to the folk legend, as the ensemble bore an uncanny resemblance to the “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door” singer’s windswept look at the Sundance Film Festival in 2003 — right down to the colors of his clothing — proving just how extensively the actor researched his latest role.</p>



<p>As for the ‘stache, the &#8220;Call Me By Your Name&#8221; star — who is dating <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/kylie_jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> — recently joked that his new facial hair might open him up to some more macho roles.</p>



<p>“I got a little somethin’ now,” he told <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/stephen_colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> as he playfully pointed to his upper lip during an interview on &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/kgEwnBxVjDU">The Late Show</a>&#8221; Dec. 12. “The first time I was on here, I hadn’t hit puberty. Now my voice has changed and, you know, I’ll probably play <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/dwayne_johnson">The Rock</a> in his next biopic.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, Chalamet is soaking up the praise for his performance as the “Blowin’ in the Wind” singer. In addition to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1410735/the-2025-golden-globe-awards-nominations-are-here">Golden Globe</a> and <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411067/the-2025-critics-choice-awards-film-nominations-are-finally-here">Critics’ Choice</a> nominations, the Little Women star <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1410847/timothee-chalamet-reacts-to-bob-dylans-praise-ahead-of-biopic-premiere">earned the support</a> of Dylan himself, who called him “a brilliant actor” on <a href="https://x.com/bobdylan/status/1864381624915231149">X (formerly Twitter)</a> Dec. 4.</p>



<p>“Floored,” Chalamet <a href="https://x.com/RealChalamet/status/1864554912366854282">wrote in response</a> on the platform. “I am so grateful. Thank you Bob.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1381502/ethan-slaters-estranged-wife-lilly-jay-slams-not-a-girls-girl-ariana-grande" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lilly Jay</a>’s life was thrust into the spotlight amid her split from <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411286/why-ariana-grande-is-singing-boyfriend-ethan-slaters-praises" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan Slater</a>.</p>



<p>In a personal essay, the clinical psychologist got candid about the ways in which <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1407314/ariana-grandes-boyfriend-ethan-slater-finalizes-divorce-from-wife" target="_blank">her divorce from the Wicked actor</a> — with whom she shares a 2-year-old son — affected her personal life and career as <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409738/inside-wicked-costars-ariana-grande-and-ethan-slaters-magical-romance" target="_blank">her former partner moved on with</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/ariana_grande" target="_blank">Ariana Grande</a>, though Jay doesn’t name either by name.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to measure an absence, and I can’t say for sure how much my career has been impacted by what’s out there online,” she wrote in <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/lilly-jay-divorce-essay-therapy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her essay for The Cut</a>, published Dec. 19. “But there have been hints along the way, like the job offer that dissolved without explanation after yet another tabloid news cycle or the patient who’s scheduled for a first appointment but seemingly vanishes.”</p>



<p>She added, “On my darker days, I railed against the unfairness of a public divorce, asking my therapist, ‘Who would trust a cardiologist who had a heart attack because they never got an EKG?’”</p>



<p>Jay — who had been with Slater since high school — also spoke to how she and her former partner had decided to navigate his rising star against her preference for anonymity as a psychologist.</p>



<p><b>READ</b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1381502/ethan-slaters-estranged-wife-lilly-jay-slams-not-a-girls-girl-ariana-grande" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ethan Slater&#8217;s Estranged Wife Lilly Jay Slams &#8220;Not a Girl&#8217;s Girl&#8221; Ariana Grande</a></p>



<p>“My partner was on a different path, in which social media and exposure were not impediments but rather necessities,” she wrote. “We puzzled through this predicament on walks, over pizza, in our apartment and excitedly concocted rules of engagement of how and what he would share about our lives together. It was a tenuous balance — my profession, which requires privacy, and his, which is measured in applause — but it worked well while life was unfolding according to our plans.”</p>



<p>Yet, Jay also spoke to the ways in which her plans did not turn out as she’d expected, including finalizing her divorce with her high school sweetheart in September, two years after welcoming their son in Aug. 2022.</p>



<p>“During my pregnancy, I had never felt happier nor more aware of how precarious happiness could be,” she wrote, adding of welcoming her son, “I survived preeclampsia, a life-threatening birth complication, and finally, our family was whole. Mine is a story of worrying in the wrong direction.”</p>



<p>While noting her knowledge as a psychologist of how challenging the postpartum period can be on a marriage, she continued, “But I confidently moved to another country with my 2-month-old baby and my husband to support his career. Consumed by the magic and mundanity of new motherhood, I didn’t understand the growing distance between us.”</p>



<p>Now, Jay noted how she’s looking to the future amid the public scrutiny on her life.</p>



<p>“I work diligently on my private project of accepting the sudden public downfall of my marriage,” she added. “This, I tell myself, is nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to hide. Slowly but surely, I have come to believe that in the absence of the life I planned with my high-school sweetheart, a lifetime of sweetness is waiting for me and my child.”</p>



<p>She also spoke to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1411354/ethan-slaters-ex-lilly-jay-shares-update-on-coparenting-dynamic-after-their-split" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her current dynamic with Slater</a>. “While our partnership has changed, our parenthood has not,” she noted. “Both of us fiercely love our son 100 percent of the time, regardless of how our parenting time is divided.”</p>



<p>For his part, Slater has <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409298/ethan-slater-addresses-really-difficult-speculation-about-ariana-grande-relationship" target="_blank">previously spoken to the public backlash</a> his and Grande&#8217;s relationship garnered amid rumors of infidelity.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Paula Abdul and former <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/reality-tv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“American Idol” </a>producer Nigel Lythgoe have agreed to settle a lawsuit in which she alleged he <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/crime-and-courts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexually assaulted </a>her in the early 2000s when she was a judge on the show.</p>



<p>Abdul filed a notice of settlement of the case in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday. It still must be approved by a judge.</p>



<p>“I am grateful that this chapter has successfully come to a close and is now something I can now put behind me,&#8221; Abdul said in a statement Friday. &#8220;This has been a long and hard-fought personal battle. I hope my experience can serve to inspire other women, facing similar struggles, to overcome their own challenges with dignity and respect, so that they too can turn the page and begin a new chapter of their lives.”</p>



<p>The court filing said the settlement was unconditional, but did not reveal the terms, and Abdul&#8217;s attorney Melissa Eubanks said she could not comment on them.</p>



<p>An email seeking comment from attorneys for Lythgoe was not immediately answered.</p>

<p>The lawsuit filed nearly a year ago had also accused Lythgoe of sexually assaulting Abdul after she left “American Idol” and became a judge on Lythgoe&#8217;s other competition show, “So You Think You Can Dance.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lythgoe said at the time that he was “shocked and saddened” by the allegations, which he called “an appalling smear.” </p>



<p>After other lawsuits were filed alleging sexual misconduct, Lythgoe stepped down in January from his role as a judge on “So You Think You Can Dance.” </p>



<p>The 75-year-old English-born producer has been a prominent TV producer for decades in both the U.K. and the U.S., working on reality competition shows including “American Idol.”</p>



<p>The Associated Press generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, as Abdul has done.</p>



<p>Abdul, a Grammy and Emmy-winning singer and dancer, said in the lawsuit that she remained silent for years about the alleged assaults out of fear of retaliation by “one of the most well-known producers of television competition shows.”</p>



<p>She alleged that the first sexual assault occurred while Abdul and Lythgoe were on the road filming auditions for an early season of “American Idol,” which premiered in 2002.</p>



<p>Abdul says Lythgoe groped her in the elevator of their hotel after a day of filming and “began shoving his tongue down her throat.” Abdul pushed him away and ran to her hotel room when the elevator doors opened.</p>



<p>“In tears, Abdul quickly called one of her representatives to inform them of the assault,” the lawsuit says, “but ultimately decided not to take action for fear that Lythgoe would have her fired.”</p>



<p>Abdul starred as a judge for the first eight seasons, leaving in 2009.</p>



<p>In 2015, Abdul became a judge on “So You Think You Can Dance,” appearing alongside Lythgoe.</p>



<p>Around that time, Abdul alleged in the lawsuit, Lythgoe forced himself on top of her during a dinner at his home and tried to kiss her. Abdul said she again pushed Lythgoe away and immediately left.</p>



<p>Abdul left that reality show after two seasons. She has not worked with Lythgoe since.</p>



<p>In a statement at the time of the suit, Lythgoe said “While Paula’s history of erratic behavior is well known, I can’t pretend to understand exactly why she would file a lawsuit that she must know is untrue.” </p>
