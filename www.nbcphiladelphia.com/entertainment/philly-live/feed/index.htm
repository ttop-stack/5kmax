				<![CDATA[
<p>The lights are bright at Rockefeller Center as the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/holidays/who-donated-rockefeller-center-christmas-tree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11-ton Norway Spruce</a> outside dazzles once again with tens of thousands of LED lights to mark the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holiday season</a>. </p>



<p>While Christmas and holiday decorations have been showing up in New York City over the past few weeks, none represents the start of the season and spirit of NYC than the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree.</p>



<p>This year&#8217;s tree is from <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">West Stockbridge, Massachusetts</a> &#8212; the first tree to come from that state since 1959. The tree is an 11-ton Norway Spruce that&#8217;s 74-feet tall and 43-feet wide. A Swarovski star crown sparkling with 3 million crystals will top it.</p>



<p>There are more than 50,000 multi-colored LED lights on the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, connected by approximately five miles worth of wire.</p>





<p>The annual Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree Lighting attracted more than just people. A few snow flurries came down during some star-studded performances next to the iconic skating rink. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the night&#8217;s performers:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kelly Clarkson</li>



<li>The Backstreet Boys</li>



<li>Dan + Shay</li>



<li>Megan Hilty</li>



<li>Jennifer Hudson</li>



<li>Coco Jones</li>



<li>Little Big Town</li>



<li>RAYE</li>



<li>Thalia</li>



<li>The Radio City Rockettes</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When is the Rockefeller Christmas tree lit every day?</h2>



<p>The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree is lit daily from 5 a.m. to midnight.</p>



<p>On Christmas Eve, the tree will be lit for an entire 24 hours, whereas on New Year&#8217;s Eve, the spruce will be illuminated from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How long will the Rockefeller Christmas tree be up?</h2>



<p>Rockefeller&#8217;s Christmas Tree will be on display to the public through mid-January 2025.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>What happens to the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree after it comes down?</strong></h2>



<p>The tree goes from providing Christmas joy to providing housing.</p>



<p>When the tree is taken down, it is laid in Rockefeller Plaza to be cut up and taken to a yard in New Jersey. There it is milled into two-by-four and two-by six beams and branded with a Rockefeller Center stamp. Tishman Speyer, the firm that owns and operates Rockefeller Center, then donates the lumber to Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit organization that helps to build and improve homes across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Who is Kendrick Lamar?</h2>



<p>Kendrick Lamar – born Kendrick Lamar Duckworth in Compton, California, &#8212; is a Grammy award and Pulitzer Prize-winning hip-hop artist. Lamar has released six studio albums, five of which have been certified multiplatinum or platinum, and four of which reached number one on the US Billboard 200.</p>



<p>Throughout his career, Lamar has won 17 Grammy Awards, four American Music Awards, 37 BET Hip Hop Awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards and six Billboard Music Awards.</p>



<p>His 2017 album “Damn” also won the 2018 Pulitzer Price for Music and is the first non-classical and non-jazz album to receive the honor.</p>



<p>This year was a particularly memorable one for Lamar. He was involved in a highly publicized feud with fellow hip hop artist Drake which spawned multiple diss tracks between the two rappers, including Lamar’s hit song “Not Like Us” which broke several records on the streaming platform Spotify and reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.</p>



<p>Lamar was also named the headliner of the Super Bowl LIX halftime show after co-headlining the halftime show of Super Bowl LVI in 2022.</p>



<p>On Nov. 22, 2024, <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/kendrick-lamar-new-album-gnx-surprise/4036315/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/kendrick-lamar-new-album-gnx-surprise/4036315/">Lamar released his surprise album “GNX.”</a>&nbsp; The album received critical acclaim, debuted on top of the Billboard 200 with 319,000 album-equivalent units and <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/">currently features seven songs in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.</a> Lamar joined his rival Drake, Taylor Swift and the Beatles as the only artists to occupy the Hot 100’s entire top five at the same time.</p>



<p>Known for his lyricism and storytelling ability, Lamar is considered by many to be one of the greatest rappers of all time and one of the most influential artists of his generation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Who is SZA?</h2>



<p>SZA &#8212;&nbsp; born Solána Imani Rowe in St. Louis, Missouri – is a grammy-award winning R&amp;B artist who grew up in Maplewood, New Jersey. She has released two studio albums, three extended plays and one live album. Both her 2017 album “Ctrl” and her 2022 album “SOS” were certified triple platinum, with the latter debuting at number one on the Billboard 200. “SOS” also broke the record for the largest streaming week for an R&amp;B album in the U.S. and spent ten non-consecutive weeks on top of the Billboard 200.</p>



<p>She is expected to release her third studio album “Lana” at some point in 2024.</p>



<p>Known for her vulnerable and thought-provoking lyrics, SZA’s music features elements of R&amp;B, hip hop, pop and rock music. She has received critical acclaim and has won four Grammy Awards, an American Music Award and two Billboard Women in Music awards, including Woman of the Year.</p>



<p>SZA has worked closely with Lamar throughout their careers. They were both labelmates on the independent record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) and have collaborated on several songs, including “All the Stars,” the 2018 lead single off the “Black Panther” soundtrack that was nominated for Best Original Song at the 76<sup>th</sup> Golden Globe Awards and 91<sup>st</sup> Academy Awards as well as Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the 61<sup>st</sup> Grammy Awards.</p>

<ul>
<li>Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Moana 2,&#8221; Universal&#8217;s &#8220;Wicked&#8221; and Paramount&#8217;s &#8220;Gladiator II&#8221; pushed the five-day Thanksgiving holiday to its biggest haul in cinematic history.</li>



<li>&#8220;Moana 2&#8221; led with $221 million in domestic ticket sales, the top performance of a Thanksgiving weekend film ever.</li>



<li>&#8220;Wicked&#8221; continued to soar, adding $117.5 million in estimated ticket sales for the holiday.</li>



<li>&#8220;Gladiator II&#8221; tallied an additional $44 million over the same period.</li>
</ul>



<p>It was all feast and no famine at the Thanksgiving box office this year.</p>



<p>The tag-team of Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Moana 2,&#8221; Universal&#8217;s &#8220;Wicked&#8221; and Paramount&#8217;s &#8220;Gladiator II&#8221; pushed the five-day Thanksgiving holiday to its biggest haul in cinematic history — an estimated $420 million as of Sunday.</p>



<p>&#8220;A perfect storm of Thanksgiving box office, powered by a trio of films from the musical, epic drama, and family film genres, has arrived at the most advantageous moment to reinvigorate the theatrical marketplace after a post-summer malaise,&#8221; said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.</p>



<p>&#8220;Moana 2&#8221; led the frame with $221 million for the five-day period, a significant overperformance compared to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/moana-2-thanksgiving-box-office-projections.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108069685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100 million box office analysts had initially expected.</a> It marked the highest Thanksgiving weekend performance of a film ever, beating out 2019&#8217;s &#8220;Frozen II&#8221; which snared $125 million during the period.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wicked&#8221; continued to soar with $117.5 million in estimated ticket sales for the holiday, bringing its total domestic haul to $262.42 million. It is now the highest-grossing Broadway adaptation of all time at the domestic box office. Globally, the film stands at $359.2 million after 10 days in theaters.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gladiator II&#8221; added $44 million to the Thanksgiving total. It has snared an estimated $111.2 million in domestic ticket sales during its first 10 days in theaters and $320 million globally since opening internationally earlier this month.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is no shortage of words to describe the historic weekend we&#8217;ve seen unfold at movie theaters,&#8221; said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. &#8220;When one film exceeds expectations in the way &#8216;Moana 2&#8217; has, that alone is a big story. When fellow tentpole films like &#8216;Wicked&#8217; and &#8216;Gladiator II&#8217; excel at the same time, it&#8217;s a powerful reminder of the importance moviegoing continues to hold in our culture.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Thanksgiving holiday haul hasn&#8217;t topped $200 million since 2019, according to data from Comscore. And, prior to this weekend, only one Thanksgiving period had surpassed $300 million.</p>



<p>The previous record was held by 2018′s slate, which was led by &#8220;Ralph Breaks the Internet,&#8221; &#8220;Creed II&#8221; and &#8220;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.&#8221; These titles helped generate $315 million in ticket sales combined.</p>



<p>This year&#8217;s overperformance at the box office during the Thanksgiving period has also helped narrow the gap between 2024 and 2023&#8217;s hauls. The 2024 box office was hit hard following dual labor strikes in Hollywood the previous year, which halted production and pushed many of the major blockbuster releases to 2025 and beyond.</p>



<p>Heading into this holiday period, the 2024 box office was down 11% compared to the previous year&#8217;s numbers. Now, it&#8217;s just 6.4% behind, according to data from Comscore.</p>



<p><em>Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal distributed &#8220;Wicked&#8221; and owns &#8220;Fandango.&#8221;<br></em></p>

				<![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/saturday-night-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Saturday Night Live”</a> tackled the controversy over Peanut the squirrel’s death.</p>



<p>Peanut was<a href="https://www.today.com/news/peanut-the-squirrel-controversy-explained-rcna178506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;an Instagram-famous squirrel who was euthanized last month</a>&nbsp;after he and a raccoon named Fred were confiscated from their owner’s home following several anonymous complaints to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i82eLCdqM0" target="_blank">a “Weekend Update” appearance</a>, cast member Sarah Sherman took on the role of Peanut’s widow to share her thoughts on his untimely death. Dressed from head to tail in a realistic squirrel costume, Sherman’s squirrelly look was accented with a black woven shawl and pill box hat as she continued to mourn the loss of her husband, Peanut.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Colin Jost thanked Sherman for being there, referring to her as Mrs. Nut before she insisted that he just simply call her Hazel.</p>



<p>Jost asked Sherman how she was handling Peanut&#8217;s death, causing her to open up about how hard it was to be “thrust in the media spotlight.”</p>



<p>“I’m used to doing regular squirrel stuff, like chasing my own tail or running into the middle of a street, seeing a car, and then,” she explained, before she started to panic and shake and then froze and stared straight ahead.</p>



<p>Sherman recalled the day that she and Peanut had first met, sharing that she was minding her own business near a tree as she was “sqwerking.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Jost questioned the act, Sherman explained, “It’s when a squirrel shakes their entire body to attract a mate like this.” She then demonstrated the act by standing up and shaking her body uncontrollably as she panted.</p>



<p>Jost pointed out that she “looked a little nuts,” which caused her to freak out and yell, “Nuts? Where?” before shaking violently again in excitement. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When prompted by Jost to share more about <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/peanut-squirrel-euthanized-negative-rabies/5978856/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peanut’s demise,</a> Sherman explained, “Well, the cops raided our house and then Peanut bit one like a damn hero.”</p>



<p>“Anyways, then they abducted Peanut and chopped his head off in a rabies test, that’s how they really test for rabies, Colin,” Sherman added.</p>



<p>Jost tried to provide comfort to Sherman during her time of mourning, expressing that he hoped she could find closure and move on after Peanut’s death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh, what life? I’m a widow at four, Colin,” Sherman said. “I’m so old, that the only person that wants to hit it is Jake Paul.”</p>



<p>Sherman said that she couldn’t take it anymore and was “going nuts” before responding to herself, “Nuts? Where?” which sent her into another tizzy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Charli XCX returned to “SNL” on Nov. 16, this time taking on double duty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed, the former <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/NFL/">NFL</a> player’s new song with Stevie Nicks “Maybe This Christmas,” off his annual charity Christmas album with <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/philadelphia-eagles/">Philadelphia Eagles</a> teammates knocked <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/mariah_carey">Mariah Carey</a>’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You&#8221; off the top spot on the iTunes holiday chart.</p>



<p>After delivering the news to him during their &#8220;<a>New Heights</a>&#8221; podcast on Nov. 13, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/travis_kelce">Travis Kelce</a> bestowed Jason with a new title. </p>



<p>“Jason, how does it feel to be the new Queen of Christmas?” Travis asked his brother.</p>



<p>&#8220;You know, I&#8217;ve fought my whole life to be the Queen of Christmas,” Jason joked back, “and the fact that we&#8217;re finally there is just really special.&#8221; </p>



<p>While Jason Kelce and Nicks took over the top spot on iTunes<a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409402/mariah-carey-ushers-in-the-holidays-in-two-snaps-with-addams-family-themed-video">, Carey’s 1994 single has faced no shortage of major honors.</a> The official Queen of Christmas&#8217; hit has sat on the top of Billboard&#8217;s Hot Holidays Chart for 60 weeks. </p>



<p><b><strong>READ</strong></b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409966/jason-kelce-offers-up-nsfw-explanation-for-why-men-have-beards"><strong> Jason Kelce Offers Up NSFW Explanation for Why Men Have Beards</strong></a></p>





<p>The ESPN commentator revealed that he has an idea why the song caught steam so early in the holiday season.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know we caught it in early November. We&#8217;ll see if it holds up throughout the rest of Christmas,&#8221; Jason Kelce continued. &#8220;We kind of caught it on the Christmas downslide, like, not too many people are listening to Christmas music so we jumped up in there.&#8221;</p>



<p>His duet with the Fleetwood Mac frontwoman appears on the upcoming &#8220;A Philly Special Christmas Party&#8221; out Nov. 22. The annual holiday album Jason Kelce and former teammates Jordan Mailata and Lane Johnson — a vocal trio known as The Philly Specials — release for charity.</p>



<p>And for the athlete getting to work with the legendary musician — who is friends with Travis’ girlfriend Taylor Swift — was nothing short of a dream. </p>



<p>“It was incredible to sing with Stevie Nicks,” Jason told Travis. “I’m just in awe that actually happened. This is really, really cool. There’s no percent chance that any song that I am in should be streaming number one on any service in any genre.”</p>



<p>Giving his brother no credit for the song’s success, Travis quipped back, “Don’t give yourself too much credit, it’s Stevie Nicks.”</p>

<p>Feeling &#8220;Numb&#8221; as you waited for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fromzero.linkinpark.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fromzero.linkinpark.com/" target="_blank">Linkin Park</a> to return to the road? This concert news will leave you feeling &#8220;Faint.&#8221;</p>



<p>Linkin Park is &#8220;Crawling&#8221; into Philadelphia in 2025.</p>



<p>Here are the details on how you can see Emily Armstrong, Mike Shinoda, Dave “Phoenix” Farrell, Joe Hahn and Colin Brittain take the Wells Fargo Center stage this summer as they celebrate the new album &#8220;From Zero.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>When will Linkin Park &#8216;Burn It Down&#8217; in Philadelphia in 2025?</strong></h2>



<p>Linkin Park will play the Wells Fargo Center on Saturday, Aug. 16, 2024. Jean Dawson is set to open the concert.</p>



<p>The show is part of the North American leg of the tour that <a href="https://fromzero.linkinpark.com/tour" data-type="link" data-id="https://fromzero.linkinpark.com/tour" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently has the band playing overseas</a> this fall.</p>



<p>&#8220;Getting back out on the road has been incredible,” Shinoda said. “The fans’ support is overwhelming, and we’re ready to take this energy even further around the world. &#8216;FROM ZERO&#8217; is a new chapter for us, and we’re so excited to share it with everyone on a bigger scale.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409664/john-krasinski-revealed-as-peoples-sexiest-man-alive-2024" target="_blank">E! Online</a></em>.</p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">Dunder Mifflin once employed the sexiest man alive.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;The Office&#8221; alum <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/john_krasinski" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:400">John Krasinski</span></a> was revealed as People’s Sexiest Man Alive for 2024 during the Nov. 12 episode of &#8220;The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.</span>&#8220;</p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">And when host <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/stephen_colbert" target="_blank">Stephen Colbert</a> noted that it was Krasinski&#8217;s kindness and thoughtfulness that earned him the honor, the actor quipped, </span>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s that — and the biceps.&#8221; </p>



<p>So, how did <span style="font-weight:400">Krasinski</span> react when he found out he won the coveted title? “Just immediate blackout, actually. Zero thoughts,” the 45-year-old told the <a href="https://people.com/sexiest-man-alive-2024-john-krasinski-reveal-8743226" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">magazine</a> in an article published Nov. 12. “Other than maybe I&#8217;m being punked. That&#8217;s not how I wake up, thinking, ‘Is this the day that I&#8217;ll be asked to be Sexiest Man Alive?’ And yet it was the day you guys did it. You guys have really raised the bar for me.”</p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Krasinski — who shares daughters Hazel, 10, and Violet, 8, with wife <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/emily_blunt" target="_blank">Emily Blunt</a> — revealed that the &#8220;Devil Wears Prada&#8221; actress was “very excited” when she learned about the honor, and even promised to use his magazine cover as wallpaper in their Brooklyn home. </span></span></p>



<p><b>PHOTOS</b><a href="https://www.eonline.com/photos/28711/patrick-dempsey-john-stamos-george-clooney-and-more-tv-doctors-turned-family-men"> Patrick Dempsey, John Stamos, George Clooney and More TV Doctors Turned Family Men</a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;Do we have that on camera? Because that’s like a binding contract, I think,&#8221; he joked. &#8220;My children will love that, it won’t be weird at all.&#8221;</span></span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">But really, the &#8220;Jack Ryan&#8221; star added of his wife of 14 years, “There was a lot of joy involved in me telling her.” </span></span></p>



<p>“It’s that beautiful thing where when you’re married to someone, you’re constantly learning and changing and evolving,” he explained of their marriage. “And I’m so lucky to go through all that with her.”</p>



<p>And <span style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Krasinski is</span></span> not expecting that to change now that he&#8217;s been publicly recognized as a heartthrob — he just might have to prove himself a bit more at home.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to make me do more household chores,” he joked to the magazine. “After this comes out, she’ll be like, ‘All right, that means you’re going to really earn it here at home.’&#8221;</p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">He dethroned the 2023 winner, &#8220;Grey’s Anatomy&#8221; star </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/patrick_dempsey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Dempsey</a><span style="font-weight:400">, who at the time admitted he couldn’t believe he’d earned the title.</span></span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">“I was completely shocked,” he joked to </span><a href="https://people.com/patrick-dempsey-people-sexiest-man-alive-2023-exclusive-8391684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight:400">People</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> in November 2023. “I started laughing, like, this is a joke, right? I’ve always been a bridesmaid!”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">And Dempsey wasn’t the only one in disbelief, as he revealed how his family — including wife </span>Jillian Dempsey<span style="font-weight:400"> and their kids </span>Talula Dempsey<span style="font-weight:400">, 22, as well as 17-year-old twin sons </span>Darby Dempsey<span style="font-weight:400"> and </span>Sullivan Dempsey <span style="font-weight:400">— reacted to the news.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">“They laughed quite hard,” he explained on </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/1tFzOOEJRLg?si=rw6SgMozf7qQ7HjX" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:400">&#8220;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> after being unveiled as sexiest man alive. “They were like, ‘No seriously, who is it?’’’</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">Nonetheless, Dempsey was glad he earned the title at “that point in his life.”</span></span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">“It’s nice to have the recognition,” the 58-year-old said. “And certainly my ego takes a little bump, but it gives me a platform to use it for something positive.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">Recent past winners also include <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/chris_evans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Evans</a>, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/paul_rudd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Rudd</a> and <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/idris_elba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Idris Elba</a>.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:400">And while Krasinski is the Sexiest Man Alive for 2024, he isn’t the only sexy man to get recognized this year. After all, voters also helped determine the winners in several readers’ choice polls — which featured honorees in categories ranging from &#8220;Sexiest Summer Action Star&#8221; to &#8220;Sexiest Fiyero.&#8221; (</span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1406408/bridgerton-star-jonathan-bailey-addresses-shows-brilliant-gender-swapped-storyline" target="_blank">Jonathan Bailey</a><span style="font-weight:400">, the latest actor to take on the iconic &#8220;Wicked&#8221; character, picked up that category.)</span></span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight:400">Among the winners were HGTV star </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/chip_gaines" target="_blank">Chip Gaines</a>, <span style="font-weight:400">who nailed his spot as sexiest handy man, beating out Property Brothers duo </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/jonathan_scott" target="_blank">Jonathan<span style="font-weight:400"> </span>Scott</a><span style="font-weight:400"> and </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/property_brothers" target="_blank">Drew Scott</a><span style="font-weight:400"> as well as </span>Jonathan Knigh<span style="font-weight:400">t of &#8220;Farmhouse Fixer&#8221; and T</span>y Pennington of &#8220;Rock the Block<span style="font-weight:400">.&#8221; </span></p>



<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight:400">Twilight&#8221; actor </span><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/robert_pattinson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Pattinson</a><span style="font-weight:400"> — who welcomed a baby girl with </span>Suki Waterhouse<span style="font-weight:400"> earlier this year — landed the title of sexiest first-time dad.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Universal&#8217;s &#8220;Wicked&#8221; is drumming up buzz ahead of its Nov. 22 release with hundreds of merchandise offerings from dozens of retail partners.</li>



<li>These pink-and-green collaborations cross the spectrum from apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty and costumes all the way to home decor, toys and even one-of-a-kind cars.</li>

</ul>



<p>&#8220;Barbie&#8221; painted the town pink in 2023, and now &#8220;Wicked&#8221; is upping the ante by adding a splash of green.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMCSA&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108055880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universal</a>&#8216;s theatrical retelling of the famed Broadway musical is creating buzz ahead of its Nov. 22 release with hundreds of merchandise offerings from dozens of retail partners. The green-and-pink barrage is part of Universal&#8217;s marketing strategy for the film and could bring a welcome boost to the retail industry just in time for the crucial holiday period.</p>



<p>These &#8220;Wicked&#8221; collaborations cross the spectrum from apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty and costumes all the way to home decor, toys and even one-of-a-kind cars.</p>



<p>The collections range in price points as well, offering consumers affordable and luxury options to show off their love of all things &#8220;Wicked.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108055880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Target</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108055880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart</a> have a slew of products on shelves, with whole sections of the store dedicated to themed shirts, sweaters and footwear, as well as dolls, plush figures, books and nail polish.</p>



<p>Lego and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MAT&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108055880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mattel</a> have brick sets and Barbies tied to the film; <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SBUX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108055880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starbucks</a> has a collection of new tumblers and mugs, plus limited-time drinks inspired by main characters Glinda and Elphaba; and Betty Crocker has &#8220;mix to reveal&#8221; cake mixes that turn pink or green when wet ingredients are added.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TM/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toyota&#8217;</a>s Lexus is even releasing two one-of-a-kind versions of its 2024 Lexus TX that have &#8220;Wicked&#8221;-themed wraps.</p>



<p>The Broadway show on which the film is based is one of the most popular and highest-grossing musicals of all time and already has an established and rabid fanbase.</p>



<p>Just at the Gershwin Theater in New York City, more than 14.5 million people have bought tickets to see the show since it launched in 2003, generating more than $1.67 billion in<a href="https://www.broadwayworld.com/grosses/WICKED" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ticket sales,</a> according to Broadway World. Those figures don&#8217;t include traveling national shows or international residencies.</p>



<p>These fans are hungry for merchandise that celebrates and enhances their fandom and they are willing to pay for it, according to <a href="https://clients.mintel.com/download/brochure/superfans-enthusiasts-us-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mintel&#8217;s 2024 &#8220;U.S. Superfans and Enthusiasts Consumer Report.</a>&#8220;</p>



<p>The report found that nearly half of &#8220;superfans,&#8221; the most enthusiastic and devoted fans, have spent money on official fandom events or merchandise in the past year. The report, which surveyed 2,000 adults in the U.S., also determined that fandom collaborations and partnered releases are most successful among niche super-fandoms.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s a good thing for the retail space, which saw the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/24/september-consumer-confidence-falls-the-most-in-three-years.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108055880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumer confidence index </a>fall 7 points in September, the largest drop in more than three years, only to soar up 11% in October, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/consumer-confidence-surges-as-election-nears-job-openings-move-lower.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108055880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the biggest single-month acceleration </a>since March 2021.</p>



<p>Retailers that have partnered with Universal are expected to see a boost from sales of &#8220;Wicked&#8221; merchandise, which could help them stand out from other companies during the next few months.</p>



<p>What could also drive demand is the fact that these merchandise collaborations are limited-time only. Once the stock is gone, it&#8217;s not likely to be replenished. So, even the most price-conscious consumers may be willing to spend in order to get these products before they vanish from shelves.</p>



<p>Movie theaters, too, are offering up themed popcorn buckets, drink specials and other merchandise for moviegoers who head out to cinemas to see the film. These retail opportunities could help boost the &#8220;Wicked&#8221; box office.</p>



<p>At present, box-office analysts have a wide-ranging read on what &#8220;Wicked&#8221; could do during its domestic opening weekend. On the conservative end is an $85 million haul, predicted by leading entertainment and technology research firm NRG. Meanwhile, others speculate that the first film in a planned duology could top $100 million and capture as much as $150 million during its first three days in theaters.</p>



<p>The divergence of expectations comes as Hollywood has struggled to market and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/26/dear-evan-hansen-opens-with-7point5-million-at-domestic-box-office.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108055880">make a profit</a> on movie musicals in recent years. Adaptations such as &#8220;In the Heights,&#8221; &#8220;Dear Evan Hanson&#8221; and &#8220;Mean Girls,&#8221; all based on Broadway shows, failed to drum up significant <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/14/mean-girls-opening-weekend-box-office-hits-28-million.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108055880">box-office</a> revenue during their runs.</p>



<p>However, other fan-favorite intellectual property-driven titles — including &#8220;Dune: Part Two,&#8221; &#8220;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&#8221; and &#8220;Inside Out 2&#8221; — have overperformed estimates. With &#8220;Wicked&#8221; already being a household name but existing in the musical space, box-office analysts are finding it tricky to predict where it will land.</p>

<p>Chappell Roan did not go unnoticed in this week&#8217;s episode of &#8220;<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/saturday-night-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saturday Night Live</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>The musician debuted a new single with a country music sound to it. </p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://x.com/bestofchappell/status/1852938534627225735" target="_blank">The track</a>, titled &#8220;The Giver,&#8221; has not even been released on music platforms yet.</p>



<p>&#8220;All you country boys saying you know how to treat a woman right. Well, only a woman knows how to treat a woman right,&#8221; Roan said at one point during the performance. </p>







<p>The new song came during Roan&#8217;s second performance of the night, with &#8220;Pink Pony Club&#8221; being her first song of the night. </p>



<p>This week&#8217;s episode of &#8220;SNL&#8221; also featured an <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/decision-2024/kamala-harris-saturday-night-live/">appearance by Vi</a><a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/decision-2024/kamala-harris-saturday-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">c</a><a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/decision-2024/kamala-harris-saturday-night-live/">e President Kamala Harris</a> in the cold open and <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/pete-davidson-saturday-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pete Davidson</a>. In fact, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia even made a surprise appearance in a hilarious sketch where contestants tried to guess his name. </p>







<p>John Mulaney served as host. </p>

<p>Pete Davidson returned to &#8220;<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/saturday-night-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saturday Night Live</a>&#8221; in a sketch alongside his friend and host John Mulaney, where Davidson tried to buy milk from Mulaney at a Duane Reade in New York City&#8217;s Port Authority. </p>



<p>Davidson, wearing a Rodney Dangerfield t-shirt, is in a Duane Reade alongside cast member Andrew Dismukes, who are about to go on a road trip.</p>



<p>Davidson asks to buy the store&#8217;s milk, and Mulaney, as the store clerk, strongly advises him against it. </p>



<p>&#8220;You mean the milk that&#8217;s surrounded by Twisted Iced Tea and in a fridge warmer than the rest of the store?&#8221; Mulaney asked. </p>



<p>&#8220;What? I need milk and I don&#8217;t want to make a separate stop at a supermarket in Boston. Plus, look it says its organic,&#8221; Davidson replied.</p>



<p>&#8220;It says organ,&#8221; Dismukes said, correcting him. </p>



<p>Davidson shrugged off the labeling and said he would still buy the milk, setting off a musical number featuring opossums (played by Kenan Thompson and Ego Nwodim). </p>







<p>Davidson has largely been absent from the public spotlight in recent months, but he did show off his tattoo removal recently, according <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1409150/pete-davidson-unveils-results-of-his-major-tattoo-removal?query=Pete%20Davidson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to E! Online</a>. </p>



<p>The &#8220;Bupkis&#8221; star was a cast member of the long-time sketch comedy show for eight seasons and returned as host in 2023. </p>



<p>Before Davidson, Vice President Kamala Harris <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/decision-2024/kamala-harris-saturday-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made a surprise appearance</a> on &#8220;SNL,&#8221; appearing with Maya Rudolph in the show&#8217;s cold open. </p>

<p>Live from New York, it&#8217;s Vice President Kamala Harris!</p>



<p>The Democratic nominee for president made a last-minute appearance in the cold open on &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/saturday-night-live" target="_blank">Saturday Night Live</a>,&#8221; appearing with Maya Rudolph, who has impersonated Harris on the show throughout the election season. </p>



<p>The cold open began with James Austin Johnson doing his impersonation of former President <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump</a>, who was dressed as a garbage man, alluding to something the former president really did earlier in the week. </p>



<p>The sketch then cuts to Rudolph as Harris, along with Jim Gaffigan as Harris&#8217; running mate and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Andy Samberg as Doug Emhoff. </p>



<p>The two eventually leave Rudolph as Harris alone to practice her speech. </p>



<p>&#8220;Gosh, I wish I could talk to someone who has a been in my shoes,&#8221; Rudolph as Harris said. &#8220;A Black, south Asian woman, preferably from the Bay Area.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rudolph as Harris then looks at the mirror to find the real Harris staring back at her. </p>



<p>&#8220;You and me both sister,&#8221; the real Harris said. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just here to remind you, you got this. Because you can do something your opponent cannot do, you can open doors,&#8221; the real Harris added.</p>



<p>Rudolph as Harris then impersonates the vice president&#8217;s laugh. </p>







<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really laugh like that do I?&#8221; the real Harris asked cheekily. </p>



<p>&#8220;A little,&#8221; Rudolph as Harris replied. </p>



<p>Then, it was Rudolph&#8217;s turn to share a message with the real-life Harris. </p>



<p>&#8220;Now Kamala, take my palmala,&#8221; Rudolph said. &#8220;The American people want to stop the chaos.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And end the dramala,&#8221; the real Harris joked.</p>



<p>&#8220;With a cool new step mamala,&#8221; Rudolph joked. &#8220;Get back in our pajamalas, and watch a rom-comala.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;Like Legally Blondala,&#8221; the real Harris quipped.</p>



<p>&#8220;And start decorating for Christmas. Falalala,&#8221; Rudolph said. </p>



<p>&#8220;Because what do we always say, keep calmala and carry ondala,&#8221; they both said together.</p>



<p>&#8220;We know each other so well we even finish each other&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221; Rudolph began saying before the real Harris joined in on her sentence to have them both say, &#8220;belief in the promise of America.&#8221;</p>



<p>The two then got up to say the iconic opening to &#8220;SNL.&#8221;</p>



<p>But first, Rudolph said that she would vote for &#8220;us,&#8221; or the real Harris in the presidential election. </p>



<p>&#8220;Great, any chance you&#8217;re registered in Pennsylvania?&#8221; the real Harris joked. </p>



<p>Harris&#8217; schedule originally had her traveling to Detroit after a campaign event in North Carolina on Saturday, but instead she and her campaign headed to New York City for the show. </p>



<p>The appearance was not be the first time a presidential candidate has appeared on the iconic sketch-comedy show. Last season, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/saturday-night-live-nikki-haley/" target="_blank">appeared in the show&#8217;s cold open</a> while she was running in the Republican primary. </p>



<p>Former President <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump</a> also hosted the show as a candidate in 2015, and former President Barack Obama appeared on the show in 2007.</p>



<p>Comedian John Mulaney hosted the episode alongside musical guest Chappell Roan. </p>

<ul> <li>Universal&#8217;s &#8220;Wicked,&#8221; Paramount&#8217;s &#8220;Gladiator II&#8221; and Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Moana 2&#8221; will face off at the Thanksgiving box office, each vying for time on theaters&#8217; biggest screens.</li> <li>There are currently more than 950 theaters in North America that have these PLF screens, a 33.7% jump from just five years ago.</li> <li>These screens account for 9.1% of the domestic box office, around $600 million in 2024.</li></ul>

<p>Three heavyweight Hollywood blockbusters will face off at the box office in November, each vying for audience attention, ticket sales and time on theaters&#8217; biggest screens.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMCSA&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108054947">Universal</a>&#8216;s &#8220;Wicked,&#8221; <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PARA&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108054947">Paramount</a>&#8216;s &#8220;Gladiator II&#8221; and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108054947">Disney</a>&#8216;s &#8220;Moana 2&#8221; arrive in cinemas within five days of each other, right around the Thanksgiving holiday. All three titles are expected to thrive at the box office, both during their openings and as they run through the rest of the year.</p>

<p>However, at a time when moviegoers are more discerning about how they spend their money and what films they are going to leave the couch to see, box office analysts wonder which blockbuster will benefit most from premium ticket sales.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Going premium</h4>

<p>Premium large format screens, often referred to as PLFs, are elevated viewing experiences — like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IMAX&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108054947">IMAX</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DLB&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108054947">Dolby</a>, Screen X and 4DX — that come with a higher ticket price. The physical screens are often bigger than traditional movie screens or have auditoriums that feature higher-quality sound systems or seating options.</p>

<p>&#8220;Audiences are gravitating toward the biggest, best and most immersive auditoriums,&#8221; said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics for Fandango&#8217;s movie division and founder and owner of Box Office Theory. &#8220;They are the first to sell out for high-demand movies, and opening day sales often slow down or spill into future days as those screens and their best seats fill up rather than carry over into non-premium, traditional auditoriums which are less attractive to most modern moviegoers.&#8221;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/107198579-1677121939840-gettyimages-1051853192-775239116LN023_IMAX_Private.jpeg?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite>Lars Niki | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images</cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text">General atmosphere during the Imax private screening for the movie &#8220;First Man&#8221; at an Imax AMC Theater in New York City on Oct. 10, 2018.</span></span></div></figcaption>

<p>There are currently more than 950 theaters in North America that have these PLF screens, a 33.7% jump from just five years ago, according to data from Comscore. These screens account for 9.1% of the domestic box office, around $600 million in 2024.</p>

<p>&#8220;The importance of the growth of PLFs as a percentage of the annual box office over the past few years cannot be overstated,&#8221; said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. &#8220;Notably, coming out of the pandemic, moviegoers have been gravitating toward these higher-cost movie theater options.&#8221;</p>

<p>Currently, premium ticket prices average around $16.71 a piece, according to Steve Buck of movie data firm EntTelligence, an 8% increase since 2021, when the company first started reporting these figures. Standard tickets, meanwhile, are around $11.82 each, a 7.4% jump from 2021 prices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Premium format is a significant draw for a moviegoer seeking the best immersive experience possible often representing over one-third of the foot traffic on a tentpole&#8217;s opening weekend,&#8221; Buck said.</p>

<p>Recognizing the growing importance of these types of theaters, the National Association of Theatre Owners revealed in September that the eight largest theater chains in North America would <a href="https://theatreowners.org/2024/09/19/theatre-owners-to-invest-more-than-2-2-billion-in-the-cinematic-experience/">invest more than $2.2 billion</a> to modernize and upgrade cinema locations. This investment will be spread out among updates to laser projectors, immersive sound systems and seating updates, as well as enhancing concession offerings and adding family entertainment options like bowling and arcades.</p>

<p>PLF receipts still represent a small portion of the overall box office, with most audiences seeing films on traditional digital screens. However, it&#8217;s no small feat that PLF box office has grown 33% in just five years.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Blockbusters on the biggest screen</h4>

<p>The films that benefit the most from PLF ticket sales have been Hollywood&#8217;s biggest blockbusters.</p>

<p>Audiences want to see explosive action movies and dazzling spectacles in the most state-of-the-art locations. It&#8217;s why films like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/29/oppenheimer-shows-christopher-nolans-box-office-dominance.html#:~:text=As%20of%20Sunday%2C%20%22Oppenheimer%22,since%20its%20July%2021%20debut.">Universal&#8217;s &#8220;Oppenheimer,&#8221;</a> Disney&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/06/avatar-the-way-of-water-3d-tickets.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108054947">&#8220;Avatar: The Way of Water&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/03/dune-part-two-box-office-opening-sparks-interest-in-part-three.html#:~:text=Denis%20Villeneuve's%20%22Dune%3A%20Part%20Two,ticket%20sales%2C%20or%20%2418.5%20million.">Warner Bros.&#8217; &#8220;Dune&#8221; and &#8220;Dune: Part Two&#8221;</a> captured a significant portion of the PLF box office during their runs.</p>

<p>Those films were<strong> </strong>even shot with specialty cameras with the express purpose of being seen on premium large format screens. In fact, both &#8220;Oppenheimer&#8221; and &#8220;Dune: Part Two&#8221; saw fans waiting days and even weeks to watch the film in sold-out IMAX locations.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com//api/v1/image/107278900-1690718747248-6T8A7705.jpg?w=1920&#038;h=1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="Oppenheimer film billboard in Times Square, NYC on July 29th, 2023." data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><cite>Adam Jeffery | CNBC</cite><div class="caption" data-react-component="NBCTruncate" data-maxlines="2" data-maxlinesmobile="4" data-readmore="Read more" data-text="Oppenheimer film billboard in Times Square, NYC on July 29th, 2023." data-ellipsis="false" data-component-initialized="true"><span class="truncate__wrap"><span class="truncate__text">Oppenheimer film billboard in Times Square, NYC on July 29th, 2023.</span></span></div></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So studios are betting big on franchise films. Partially, this is because audiences have come out in droves for existing intellectual property in the wake of the pandemic — just look at &#8220;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,&#8221; &#8220;Inside Out 2,&#8221; &#8220;Despicable Me 4,&#8221; &#8220;Dune: Part Two,&#8221; &#8220;Twisters,&#8221; and &#8220;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&#8221; capturing top box office receipts in 2024.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one reason why next year will see between <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/06/box-office-2025-movies-existing-intellectual-property.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108054947">50% and 70% of the movies from the six major studios</a> — Universal, Disney, Warner Bros., Paramount, Sony and Lionsgate — tied to existing IP.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also why the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday could be tricky. &#8220;Wicked&#8221; and &#8220;Gladiator II&#8221; debut first on Nov. 22 and will likely split the available PLF locations evenly. The two films opted out of the Thanksgiving fray in the months after <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/disney-is-releasing-a-moana-sequel-in-theaters-this-thanksgiving.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108054947">&#8220;Moana 2&#8221; set its Nov. 27 date.</a></p>

<p>However, as &#8220;Moana 2&#8221; enters, those premium screen divisions will change. Studios and movie theater operators strike deals when films are released designating how many theaters a movie will show in, how often and on what kinds of screens. As new movies debut, those arrangements shift. It&#8217;s unclear how the PLF screens will be split once all three movies are in theaters at the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are periods on the calendar when a release slate is slower than others, allowing one or two films to dominate premium screen ownership, but successful or potentially successful movies can be cannibalized at the box office in times of heavy competition for those top-tier screens,&#8221; Robbins said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what occurred during the &#8216;Barbenheimer&#8217; craze last year when Oppenheimer notably controlled IMAX screens for a contracted time frame before Barbie was eventually able to expand into that format weeks after its release.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many have wondered if &#8220;Wicked&#8221; and &#8220;Gladiator II&#8221; could have the potential to repeat the box office highs of 2023&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/31/barbenheimer-grosses-crosses-billion-dollar-mark.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108054947">Barbenheimer</a>&#8221; — the dual release of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WBD&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108054947">Warner Bros.&#8217;</a> &#8220;Barbie&#8221; and Universal&#8217;s &#8220;Oppenheimer&#8221; on the same weekend.</p>

<p>At present, box office analysts have a wide-ranging read on what &#8220;Wicked&#8221; could do during its domestic opening weekend. On the conservative end is an $85 million haul, predicted by leading entertainment and technology research firm NRG. Meanwhile, others speculate that the first film in a planned duology could top $100 million and capture as much as $150 million during its first three days in theaters.</p>

<p>The divergence of expectations comes as Hollywood has struggled to market and make a profit on movie musicals in recent years, but has also seen fan-favorite IP-driven titles overperform. With &#8220;Wicked&#8221; being based on one of Broadway&#8217;s most popular musicals, box office analysts are finding it tricky to predict where it will land.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, &#8220;Gladiator II&#8221; is expected to tally between $60 million and $80 million during the same weekend. &#8220;Moana 2,&#8221; which is already seeing record ticket pre-sales for an animated feature in 2024, is expected to snare more than $100 million for its full five-day domestic debut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Word of mouth on a movie itself can still ultimately be the driver in consumer choice to spend their money on movie tickets and popcorn, though,&#8221; Robbins said. &#8220;After an initial burst of strong reception and a premium screen footprint at release, certain movies transcend format preference and some casual audiences will be convinced to buy a ticket regardless of format.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin made his return to &#8220;<a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/saturday-night-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saturday Night Live</a>&#8221; with another cold open in his long and memorable &#8220;SNL&#8221; career. </p>



<p>This time, however, he was not playing former President <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump</a> and was instead playing Fox News anchor Bret Baier as he spoofed his interview this week with Vice President Kamala Harris. </p>



<p>Baldwin as Baier, interviewing Harris as Maya Rudolph, first began by asking the vice president &#8220;the number of murderers&#8221; she had let into the country.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bret, I&#8217;m glad you brought up immigration –&#8221; Rudolph as Harris was then caught off by Baldwin as Baier, who followed up with &#8220;a million? Two million?&#8221;</p>







<p>The two sparred over immigration before Rudolph as Harris concluded that she is the only candidate who has prosecuted Mexican drug cartels and that &#8220;if she was in &#8216;Breaking Bad&#8217; it would have ended in three episodes.&#8221;</p>



<p>The two then touched on the moment in the real-life interview when Baier showed Harris a clip about Trump&#8217;s &#8220;enemy from within&#8221; comment, which he doubled down on in a Fox News town hall with Fox News’ Harris Faulkner.</p>



<p>“I always say, we have two enemies,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-democrats-enemies-within-rcna175628" target="_blank">Trump said in real life</a>, adding: “We have the outside enemy, and then we have the enemy from within, and the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia and all these countries.” </p>



<p>The clip Baier showed Harris in the interview <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-fox-news-bret-baier-mistake-trump-0c60a912d98d7fb84076037486b9a3bd" target="_blank">was a mistake</a>, the anchor later said, that did not give Trump&#8217;s full answer doubling down on his &#8220;enemy from within&#8221; comments. </p>



<p>In the &#8220;SNL&#8221; sketch, James Austin Johnson reprises his role as the former president. </p>



<p>&#8220;They said I was threatening. Not true. I would never threaten anything, except, perhaps, violence,&#8221; Johnson as Trump said. </p>



<p>&#8220;I have been investigated more than Alfonse Capone, who famously did nothing wrong,&#8221; he added. </p>



<p>Dana Carvey also returned to play President <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/joe-biden" target="_blank">Joe Biden,</a> who appeared in press conference clips shown to Rudolph as Harris. Which Baldwin as Baier took out of context. </p>



<p>&#8220;Everything she touches will be destroyed, no joke. Watch out Florida,&#8221; Carvey as Biden said in one clip. </p>



<p>To which Rudolph as Harris clarified that he was talking about Hurricane Milton and not her potential presidency. </p>



<p>Also on &#8220;SNL,&#8221; Billie Eilish performed as the musical guest and Michael Keaton hosted. </p>

<p>Another local singer made the first cut on NBC&#8217;s hit singing competition, &#8220;<a href="https://www.nbc.com/the-voice" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbc.com/the-voice">The Voice</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Aliyah Khaylyn, a 23-year-old from Philadelphia, stunned the judges with her powerful cover of Tamar Braxton&#8217;s &#8220;Love and War&#8221; during her blind audition. </p>



<p>Khaylyn got all the remaining judges with room on their team to turn their chairs within the first minute of her performance. </p>



<p>“This show is called&nbsp;The Voice, and so we’re looking for your voice, right? But it’s not just about having a voice,” said coach and Grammy-award-winning singer Michael Bublé. “It’s about you having the ability to come out here and just have light shine out of you. I wish I could sing like you. I would win this competition, I think.”</p>



<p>Khaylyn received praise from all of the judges but ultimately chose to join Team Bublé. </p>







<p>&#8220;Aliyah&#8217;s got a beatuiful voice, really soulful, complete package,&#8221; said Bublé &#8220;And honestly, I was really looking for a female to round out my team.&#8221; </p>



<p>Aliyah now joins the list of other local singers that have made it past the blind auditions including <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/the-scene/the-voice-michael-buble-delaware-county-singer-replay-button/3999153/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/the-scene/the-voice-michael-buble-delaware-county-singer-replay-button/3999153/">Delaware County&#8217;s Mark Shiiba</a> who is also on Team Bublé and <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/the-scene/gabrielle-zabosky-chester-county-4-chair-turn-the-voice/3993410/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/the-scene/gabrielle-zabosky-chester-county-4-chair-turn-the-voice/3993410/">Chester County&#8217;s Gabrielle Zabosky</a> who is on team Gwen Stefani.</p>



<p>You can watch all of their journeys on &#8220;The Voice&#8221; Mondays and Tuesdays at 8/7c on NBC and streaming the next day on Peacock.</p>

<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">
<p>The Eras Tour will soon come to an end, but Taylor Swift is making sure its memories live on forever for fans.</p>



<p>Swift announced Tuesday she&#8217;s will release a new book commemorating her record-breaking tour, a first for her career, as she prepares to kick off the final leg of shows this week.</p>
</div>



<p>The artist says it will feature her own personal reflections, behind-the-scenes photos and &#8220;all the magical memories you guys brought every single night.&#8221;</p>







<p>While the pop star has had many books written about her, the Eras Tour book marks the first time she&#8217;s releasing one herself. </p>



<p>And that&#8217;s not all. In addition to the book, she announced &#8220;The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology&#8221; will be available on vinyl and CD at Target starting Nov. 29.</p>



<p><a href="https://corporate.target.com/press/release/2024/10/target-announces-exclusive-official-taylor-swift-the-eras-tour-book-available-on-black-friday#:~:text=The%20official%20%22Taylor%20Swift%20%7C%20The%20Eras%20Tour%20Book%22%20provides,personal%20reflections%20written%20by%20Taylor." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Target announced</a> the book and the vinyl and CD will be available on Black Friday when stores open.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; was first to reveal the new drops. Teasing it earlier, fans had likely been hoping for a new album release date. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/taylor-swift-channels-reputation-era-style-during-travis-kelce-date/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/taylor-swift-channels-reputation-era-style-during-travis-kelce-date/5884764/" target="_blank">They thought they had some Easter Eggs to that effect on a date night</a> with Travis Kelce over the weekend.</p>



<p>Swift returns to the stage for the first of three shows Friday night at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. <a href="https://www.taylorswift.com/tour-us/">The tour&#8217;s North American leg</a> continues in New Orleans and Indianapolis before heading to <a href="https://www.taylorswift.com/tour/">Toronto and Vancouver</a> in November and December. The final show is scheduled for Dec. 8 at BC Place in Vancouver.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Swift has been busy spending quality time with boyfriend Travis Kelce. <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/mlb/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-yankees-guardians-alcs-game-1">The two attended </a>Monday night&#8217;s New York Yankees game against the Cleveland Guardians for <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/mlb/how-to-watch-yankees-vs-guardians-2024-alcs/5881837/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game 1 of the American League Championship Series</a> on Monday.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Swift and Kelce went on a double date with actors Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds in New York City. <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/taylor-swift-channels-reputation-era-style-during-travis-kelce-date/">The couples were spotted</a> at The Corner Store in Soho. </p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>City officials have unveiled plans for <a href="https://www.phlvisitorcenter.com/rockyfest" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.phlvisitorcenter.com/rockyfest">RockyFest 2024</a>. </p>



<p>The city-wide event series will take place from Tuesday, Dec. 3, through Sunday, Dec. 8, welcoming fans from around the world to immerse themselves in all things &#8220;Rocky.&#8221; </p>



<p>Outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art on the famous steps, the Philadelphia Visitor Center, along with other city officials, celebrated Rocky Day, the kickoff of RockyFest Tuesday, with a special surprise for fans: a second cast of the Rocky statue. </p>



<p>The statue, owned by Sylvester Stallone himself, will now greet those who run &#8212; or walk &#8212; up the steps of the museum. </p>



<p>Officials said the statue will remain on display at the original Rocky III filming location through Dec. 31, offering fans a limited-time photo opportunity. </p>



<p>“The Rocky legacy has become a vital part of Philadelphia’s identity. As a symbol of triumph and determination, Rocky continues to inspire millions of people from around the world who visit each year to run the Rocky Steps and take photos with the existing Rocky statue, ” said Kathryn Ott Lovell, President &amp; CEO of the Philadelphia Visitor Center Corporation. “This installation is an extraordinary gift to our city and to our visitors, allowing them to celebrate the Rocky legacy in a truly unforgettable way for the first-ever RockyFest.”</p>



<p>A. Thoms Schomberg, a world-renowned sculptor who created the statue Rocky Balboa for the movie, “Rocky III” and the second casting of the statue, was in attendance to see the celebration of both statues now on display. </p>



<p>&#8220;What an honor. I&#8217;m humbled. I&#8217;m only a sculptor. &#8221; This city has made this possible. Certainly, Sylvester Stallone really made this story, he made it work, he described the city. He described that tenacity, better to have fought the good fight and loose than not to fight at all. Everybody has potential, everybody get it your best shot. And the sculptor is a symbol.&#8221; </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What can you expect during RockyFest 2024?</h2>

<p>Spring may be several months away but it&#8217;s never too early to start thinking about <a href="https://phsonline.org/the-flower-show" data-type="link" data-id="https://phsonline.org/the-flower-show">the Philadelphia Flower Show. </a></p>



<p>On Thursday, Sept. 26, 2024, <a href="https://phsonline.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://phsonline.org/">the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS)</a> announced tickets are currently on sale for next year&#8217;s show, which is set to take place at the Pennsylvania Convention Center from March 1 through March 9, 2025. </p>



<p>As is tradition, the upcoming show will have a new theme: Gardens of Tomorrow. </p>



<p>From getting tickets to getting there, here is everything you need to know about the event. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What is the Philadelphia Flower Show?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Philadelphia Flower Show is the nation&#8217;s largest and the world&#8217;s longest-running horticultural event. </p>



<p>Started in 1829, the event features visual displays, world-class plant competitions, family activities, artisanal crafts, educational offerings and curated shopping.&nbsp;The show also hosts world-renowned horticultural competitions, artistic floral arranging, gardening presentations and much more. </p>



<p>The show is the main fundraiser for the PHS, which is a nonprofit founded in 1827 that is focused on horticulture in the greater Philadelphia region. </p>



<p>&#8220;PHS programs create healthier living environments, increase access to fresh food, expand access to jobs and economic opportunity, and strengthen deeper social connections between people,&#8221; a spokesperson wrote. &#8220;PHS’s work spans 250 neighborhoods; an expansive network of public gardens and landscapes; year-round learning experiences; and the nation’s signature gardening event, the Philadelphia Flower Show. PHS provides everyone with opportunities to garden for the greater good as a participant, member, donor, or volunteer.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When is the 2025 Philadelphia Flower Show?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The 2025 Philadelphia Flower Show will be held from March 1 to March 9, 2025.&nbsp;More details on the exact entry times will be revealed within the coming months. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Where is the 2025 Philadelphia Flower Show?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This year’s show will once again take place at the Pennsylvania Convention Center at 1101 Arch Street in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What is the theme of the 2025 Philadelphia Flower Show?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The theme of the show is &#8220;Gardens of Tomorrow&#8221; which will invite attendees to explore &#8220;the future through the eyes of visionary designers, expert gardeners, and passionate green enthusiasts as they merge nature’s brilliance with human ingenuity,&#8221; according to event organizers. </p>



<p>&#8220;‘Gardens of Tomorrow’ invites us to envision a future where our actions today nurture a healthier planet. Through the simple act of gardening and planting trees, we plant seeds of&nbsp;hope for a greener future. The 2025 PHS Philadelphia Flower Show highlights the transformative power of plants and inspires us to create a beautiful, more resilient future together,”<strong> </strong>Seth Pearsoll, VP and Creative Director of the Philadelphia Flower Show, said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What will the 2025 Philadelphia Flower Show feature?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>PHS has not yet revealed the specific features of the show but organizers said guests can expect &#8220;imaginative designs, innovative ideas, and boundless inspiration on how to cultivate the possibilities of tomorrow through gardening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fresh off her <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/emmy-awards/" target="_blank">Emmys win</a>, Jean Smart is taking her comedy to a new audience — she’ll kick off <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/saturday-night-live/" target="_blank">“Saturday Night Live’s”</a> landmark 50th season along with musical guest Jelly Roll.</p>



<p>It will be Smart&#8217;s first time hosting and Jelly Roll&#8217;s first time performing on the show. </p>



<p>&#8220;SNL&#8221; on Wednesday announced the hosts and musical guests for its first five episodes of season 50, which premieres Sept. 28.</p>



<p>Comedian Nate Bargatze will host on Oct. 5, with Coldplay as the musical guest.</p>



<p>Ariana Grande — who stars in the upcoming “Wicked” film adaption — will host Oct. 12, with Stevie Nicks performing.</p>



<p>“Beetlejuice” star Michael Keaton will host on Oct. 19, the last show before Halloween, and Billie Eilish will be that night&#8217;s musical guest.</p>



<p>“SNL” alum John Mulaney will return to the show as host on Nov. 2, with breakout sensation Chappell Roan as the music guest.</p>







<p>The landmark 50th season of the sketch comedy show, which premiered on NBC on Oct. 11, 1975, comes with several cast changes.</p>



<p>While cast members Punkie Johnson, Molly Kearney and Chloe Troast announced their exits from the show in recent weeks, the show added&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.today.com/video/see-the-new-cast-members-of-saturday-night-live-219364421630" target="_blank">three new featured cast members</a>&nbsp;for its milestone season: Ashley Padilla, Emil Wakim and Jane Wickline.</p>



<p>And former &#8220;SNL&#8221; cast member Maya Rudolph has confirmed she will revive her <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/kamala-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vice President Kamala Harris</a> impression this season ahead of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/decision-2024/" target="_blank">the 2024 presidential election</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is healthy, happy&#8230; and has a head full of hair,&#8221; Aunyea said.</p>







<p>Despite his gaze in the photo the family shared, big brother Ezra &#8212; who turns 2 years old next month &#8212; is embracing big brother duties, Aunyea said. He blows Essence a kiss and says “good night baby” before bed.</p>



<p>Aunyea is enjoying time home with her family before she returns to Philly Live. </p>



<p>Congrats!</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>After 36 years of waiting, the juice is finally loose again in <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/movies-and-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” </a>this time racking up $110 million in its premiere weekend. </p>



<p>The long-awaited Tim Burton sequel is the third-best opening weekend of the year, only behind box office triumphs “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/actors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Keaton</a> returns as the titular spirit and Catherine O’Hara and Winona Ryder also reprise their roles as Delia and Lydia Deetz, with newcomer Jenna Ortega playing the latter’s daughter, Astrid. Willem Dafoe, Monica Bellucci and Justin Theroux round out the cast.</p>



<p>The Warner Bros. sequel is the second-highest grossing September movie of all time, only behind 2017’s “It,” which opened with a staggering $123 million. The 2019 sequel “It Chapter 2” opened with $91 million and previously held the No. 2 spot for September openings.</p>



<p>The original “Beetlejuice” film earned a mere $8 million in its opening weekend in 1988, unadjusted for inflation, but went on to make $77 million in theaters domestically as it became a cult classic. </p>







<p>“There’s life in the afterlife,” said Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. “Many things have to happen simultaneously and all the stars are aligning.”</p>



<p>Goldstein, who confirmed the film&#8217;s budget of $100 million, said the studio expected an opening weekend of between $80 million and $90 million. Given the early success, he said the film “may get really long legs” with Halloween season approaching.</p>



<p>Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, said September is “not known as a hotbed of $100 million blockbuster debuts,” but attributed part of the film&#8217;s success to Burton&#8217;s singular style and the star cast. </p>



<p>In addition to the returning cast, Ortega, who starred in the Netflix series “Wednesday” about the Addams family character, likely brought in younger audiences. </p>



<p>“If all this was were a nostalgia play for people who saw the first movie, it wouldn’t really necessarily work,” Dergarabedian said. “Part of the magic formula of ‘Beetlejuice Beetlejuice’ is having a great cast of a revered generation of actors and then having young actors who are making their own mark.”</p>



<p>The electric opening weekend kicks off the fall movie season with a bang after a sleepy Labor Day weekend and a relatively slow August that saw newer films struggle as holdover movies ruled the box office. </p>



<p>Beyond “Beetlejuice,” “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine” placed second on the box office charts, making $7.2 million in its seventh weekend. Its cumulative domestic total is now $614 million. </p>



<p>“Reagan,” the Dennis Quaid-led biopic about the 40th U.S. president, continues to beat expectations. Climbing the ranks to third place in its second weekend, the film made $5.2 million. </p>



<p>“Alien: Romulus&#8221; and “It Ends With Us,” two more holdovers from the summer, came in fourth and fifth place, respectively. The sci-fi horror film brought in $3.9 million and the romance drama brought in $3.8 million. </p>



<p>The only other new release of the weekend to make it on the box office rankings was “The Greatest of All Time,” an Indian Tamil-language science fiction action film. The movie stars Joseph Vijay and was directed by Venkat Prabhu, who is known for directing and writing other Indian action films. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.</p>



<p>1. “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” $110 million.</p>



<p>2. “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,” $7.2 million.</p>



<p>3. “Reagan,” $5.2 million.</p>



<p>4. “Alien: Romulus,” $3.9 million.</p>



<p>5. “It Ends With Us,” $3.8 million</p>



<p>6. “The Forge,” $2.9 million.</p>



<p>7. “Twisters,” $2.3 million.</p>



<p>8. “Blink Twice,” $2.1 million.</p>



<p>9. “The Greatest of All Time,” $2 million. </p>



<p>10. “Despicable Me 4,” $1.8 million.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Kendrick Lamar will pop out on the NFL&#8217;s biggest stage next year: The&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/hub/grammy-awards">Grammy</a>&nbsp;winner will headline the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show in New Orleans.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/hub/nfl">NFL</a>, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Sunday that Lamar would lead the halftime festivities from the Caesars Superdome on Feb. 9. The rap megastar, who has won 17 Grammys, said he’s looking forward to bringing hip-hop to the NFL&#8217;s championship game, where he performed as a&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-sports-50-cent-kendrick-lamar-eminem-152c957ecffac7f8f85709ac47ba3d92">guest artist with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg</a>&nbsp;in 2022.</p>



<p>“Rap music is still the most impactful genre to date,&#8221; Lamar said in a statement. &#8220;And I’ll be there to remind the world why. They got the right one.”</p>



<p>Lamar has experienced massive success since his debut album “good kid, m.A.A.d city” in 2012. Since then, he&#8217;s accumulated 17 Grammy wins and became the first non-classical, non-jazz musician to&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/ac835b25865f4199a1126176179ece9f">win a Pulitzer Prize</a>&nbsp;for his 2017 album “DAMN.”</p>



<p>The rapper&#8217;s latest album “Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers,” was released in 2022. He was featured on the song “Like That” with Future and Metro Boomin on a track that spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 this year. He also garnered another hit with “Not Like Us.&#8221;</p>



<p>Roc Nation founder Jay-Z called Lamar a “once-in-a-generation” artist and performer.</p>



<p>“His deep love for hip-hop and culture informs his artistic vision,” Jay-Z said. “He has an unparalleled ability to define and influence culture globally. Kendrick’s work transcends music, and his impact will be felt for years to come.”</p>



<p>Roc Nation and Emmy-winning producer Jesse Collins will serve as co-executive producers of the halftime show. The creative direction of Lamar&#8217;s performance will be provided by pgLang.</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&#8221; topped $1 billion at the global box office over the weekend, becoming only the second R-rated film to achieve this feat.</li>



<li>Currently, the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time is Warner Bros.&#8217; &#8220;Joker,&#8221; which tallied $1.078 billion during is theatrical run in 2019.</li>



<li>This third stand-alone feature starring Ryan Reynolds as the regenerating degenerate has already posted the highest opening of any film released in 2024 and holds the record for the highest debut of an R-rated film ever.</li>
</ul>



<p>The &#8220;Merc with a Mouth&#8221; is breaking even more box office records.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108018917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney</a> and Marvel&#8217;s &#8220;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&#8221; became only the second R-rated film to top $1 billion at the global box office. And it&#8217;s on its way to becoming the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.</p>



<p>Currently, that record is held by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WBD&amp;__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108018917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros.&#8217;</a> &#8220;Joker,&#8221; which tallied $1.078 billion during is theatrical run in 2019, according to data from Comscore. As of Sunday&#8217;s estimated numbers, &#8220;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&#8221; has tallied $1.029 billion.</p>



<p>&#8220;This film set the blueprint for how to create the perfect box office beast, from a novel marketing strategy that included a viral popcorn bucket to a perfect release date, Ryan Reynolds&#8217; tireless promotion of the film and, most importantly, a great movie that was embraced by critics and fans alike, led up to this moment a mere three weeks into the film&#8217;s amazing run in theatres across the globe,&#8221; said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. &#8220;Another great moment for Disney after what was a rather slow post-pandemic period for the studio.&#8221;</p>



<p>This third stand-alone feature starring Ryan Reynolds as the regenerating degenerate has already posted the highest opening of any film released in 2024 and holds the record for the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/28/deadpool-and-wolverine-box-office-opening-tops-205-million.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108018917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest debut of an R-rated film ever.</a></p>



<p>&#8220;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&#8221; is the first R-rated Marvel Cinematic Universe flick, as the previous two Deadpool films were produced and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Disney acquired that studio back in 2019.</p>



<p>It is also the second Disney film to top $1 billion at the global box office this year. Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Inside Out 2&#8221; has generated more than $1.5 billion since its opening in June. Box office analysts expect &#8220;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&#8221; won&#8217;t be the last for the company this year, either. &#8220;Moana 2&#8221; is set to hit theaters over the Thanksgiving holiday and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/08/3-disney-films-could-top-1-billion-at-box-office-this-year.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108018917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forecasts suggest it could also reach the billion-dollar mark.</a></p>



<p>These massive box office successes come after a string of misfires from Disney&#8217;s traditionally bulletproof franchises, including the lowest opening and lowest haul for a Marvel film ever. As Disney seeks to rebuild its reputation and recapture magic at the box office, it is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/10/disney-is-hoping-for-a-box-office-rebound-built-on-sequels-prequels-and-pixie-dust.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108018917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relying heavily on existing, and beloved, franchises</a>. During the company&#8217;s biannual D23 Expo, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/10/everything-we-learned-at-disneys-parks-panel-at-the-2024-d23-expo.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108018917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it shared details</a> about upcoming titles from all of its studios.</p>



<p>This includes major animated sequels like &#8220;Toy Story 5,&#8221; &#8220;Zootopia 2,&#8221; &#8220;Frozen III&#8221; and &#8220;Incredibles 3,&#8221; as well as a slew of new Marvel titles like &#8220;Captain America: Brave New World,&#8221; &#8220;Thunderbolts*,&#8221; &#8220;The Fantastic 4: First Steps,&#8221; &#8220;Blade,&#8221; &#8220;Avengers: Doomsday&#8221; (previously titled &#8220;Avengers: Kang Dynasty) and &#8220;Avengers: Secret Wars.&#8221; There was also footage shown of &#8220;The Mandalorian and Grogu,&#8221; the first Star War film set to grace the big screen since &#8220;The Rise of Skywalker&#8221; in 2019.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise Disney is going back to the well with these films. The Toy Story franchise has generated $3.2 billion at the global box office, the two Frozen films surpassed $2.7 billion worldwide, the two Incredibles films tallied $1.8 billion globally, and &#8220;Zootopia&#8221; reached $1 billion worldwide during its run in 2016.</p>



<p>As for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it is the highest-grossing film franchise of all time, topping $30 billion at the global box office since 2008. And Star Wars has a solid track record, too, generating more than $10 billion in ticket sales since &#8220;A New Hope&#8221; hit theaters in 1977.</p>



<p>&#8220;The billion dollar box office club may not be the singular metric by which theatrical success is defined, but it is still emblematic of a film&#8217;s ability to capture the global zeitgeist,&#8221; said Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory, a theatrical and box office consultation and analysis firm. &#8220;&#8216;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&#8217; has done that in a resounding way, making Disney and Marvel&#8217;s return to the ten-digit summit worth celebrating.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/movies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Despicable Me 4,” </a>the Illumination Animation sequel, led the way over the holiday weekend with $75 million in ticket sales Friday through Sunday and $122.6 million since opening on Wednesday, according to studio estimates Sunday.</p>



<p>The Independence Day holiday weekend haul for the Universal Pictures release further extends the considerable box-office reign of the Minions, arguably the most bankable force in movies today. And it also kept a summer streak going for <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/hollywood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood.</a></p>



<p>Though overall ticket sales were down more than 40% from levels prior to the COVID 19 pandemic, heading into the summer moviegoing season, theaters have lately seen a succession of hits. After Sony’s “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” outperformed expectations, Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” rapidly cleared $1 billion in ticket sales worldwide, making it the first release since “Barbie” to reach that mark. Last weekend, the Paramount prequel “A Quiet Place: Day One” also came in above expectations.</p>



<p>With “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine” tracking for a $160 million launch later this month, Hollywood’s summer is looking up.</p>



<p>“If you look at the mood of the industry about eight weeks ago, very different than today,” says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “The song says what a difference a day makes. What a difference a month has made.”</p>



<p>It helps to have the Minions at your disposal. Since first debuting in the 2010 original “Despicable Me,” each entry of the franchise — including two sequels and two “Minions” spinoffs — has been seemingly guaranteed to gross around $1 billion. The four previous movies all made between $939 million (2022’s “Minions: Rise of Gru”) and $1.26 billion (2015’s “Minions”) globally.</p>

<p>That run has helped give Illumination founder and chief executive Chris Meledandri one of the most enviable track records in Hollywood. “Despicable Me 4,” directed by Chris Renaud and Patrick Delage, returns the voice cast led by Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig and doubles down on more Minion mayhem. Reviews (54% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren’t particularly good for the latest installment, which includes a witness protection plot and a group of Minions transformed into a superhero squadron. But in their 12-year run, little has slowed down the Minions.</p>



<p>“This is one of the most beloved franchises, quite frankly, in the history of film, and certainly animation,” said Jim Orr, distribution chief for Universal. “Chris Meledandri and Illumination have their finger on the pulse of what families and audiences around the world want to see.”</p>



<p>Family movies are powering the box office. “Despicable Me 4” performed strongly despite the still considerable drawing power of “Inside Out 2.” In its fourth weekend of release, the Pixar sequel added another $30 million domestically and $78.3 million overseas.</p>



<p>“Inside Out 2,” with $1.22 billion in ticket sales thus far, is easily the year’s biggest hit and fast climbing up the all-time ranks for animated releases. It currently ranks as the No. 5 animated release worldwide.</p>



<p>Instead of cannibalizing the opening weekend for “Despicable Me 4,” “Inside Out 2” may have helped get families back in the habit of heading to theaters.</p>



<p>“What happened, I think, is the release calendar finally settled into a nice rhythm,” said Dergarabedian, referencing the jumbled movie schedule from last year’s strikes. “It’s all about momentum.”</p>



<p>The continued strong sales for “Inside Out 2” were enough to put the film in second place for the domestic weekend. Last week’s top new film, “A Quiet Place: Day One,” slid to third with $21 million in its second weekend, with another $21.1 million from overseas theaters. That was a steep decrease of 60%, though the Paramount prequel has amassed $178.2 million worldwide in two weeks.</p>



<p>The run of hits has caused some studios to boost their forecasts for the summer movie season. Heading into the most lucrative season at theaters, analysts were predicting a $3 billion summer, down from the more typical $4 billion mark. Now, closer to $3.4 billion appears likely.</p>



<p>The weekend’s other top new release was Ti West’s “MaXXXine,” the third in a string of slasher films from A24 starring Mia Goth. In 2,450 locations, “MaXXXine” collected $6.7 million in ticket sales, a franchise best. The film, which follows “X” and “Pearl” (both released in 2022), stars Goth as a 1980s Hollywood starlet being hunted by a killer known as the Night Stalker.</p>



<p>Angel Studios, which last year released the unexpected summer hit “Sound of Freedom,” struggled to find the same success with its latest Christian film, “Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot.” It debuted with $3.2 million.</p>



<p>Kevin Costner’s big-budget gamble, “Horizon: An American Saga,” didn’t do much to turn around its fortunes in its second weekend. The first chapter in what Costner hopes will be a four-part franchise – including a chapter two Warner Bros. will release in August – earned $5.5 million in its second weekend. The film, which cost more than $100 million to make, has grossed $22.2 million in two weeks.</p>



<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.</p>



<p>1. “Despicable Me 4,” $75 million.</p>



<p>2. “Inside Out 2,” $30 million.</p>



<p>3. “A Quiet Place Day One,” $21 million.</p>



<p>4. “MaXXXine,” $6.7 million.</p>



<p>5. “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” $6.5 million.</p>



<p>6. “Horizon: An American Saga, Chapter 1,” $5.5 million.</p>



<p>7. “Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,” $3.2 million.</p>



<p>8. “Kaiki 2898,” $1.8 million.</p>



<p>9. “The Bikeriders,” $1.3 million.</p>



<p>10. “Kinds of Kindness,” $860,000.</p>

<p>This &#8220;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1375623/every-time-margot-robbie-channeled-barbie-irl?query=margot%2520robbie%2520barbie" target="_blank">Barbie</a>&#8221; is entering her Midge era.</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s the discontinued BFF of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/margot_robbie" target="_blank">Margot Robbie</a>&#8216;s &#8220;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1375623/every-time-margot-robbie-channeled-barbie-irl?query=margot%2520robbie%2520barbie" target="_blank">Barbie&#8221; </a>character that is best known for rocking her pregnancy style, the Oscar nominee is putting her own twist on maternity fashion as she is expecting her first baby with husband <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1381771/inside-margot-robbie-and-tom-ackerleys-dreamy-love-story" target="_blank">Tom Ackerley</a>.</p>



<p>On July 7, the actress was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13609203/Margot-Robbie-flashes-midriff-Lake-Como-husband-Tom-Ackerley.html">photographed</a> wearing a crop top and showcasing what appeared to be a baby bump while vacationing with her husband in Lake Como, Italy. Multiple sources later confirmed to <a href="https://people.com/margot-robbie-is-pregnant-expecting-first-baby-with-tom-ackerley-7502812">People</a> that Robbie is pregnant. </p>



<p>E! News has reached out to the couple&#8217;s reps and has not heard back.</p>



<p>The couple&#8217;s new chapter comes more than seven years after they tied the knot in a <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/780460/margot-robbie-secretly-marries-tom-ackerley-reports?query=margot%2520robbie%2520married" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">private ceremony</a> in her native Australia. And for Robbie, growing her and Ackerley&#8217;s family has always been a goal.</p>



<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m looking into my future 30 years from now, I want to see a big Christmas dinner with tons of kids there,&#8221; Robbie told <a href="https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/porter/article-3a33035208191633" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porter</a> in a 2018 interview. &#8220;But definitely not at the moment. That&#8217;s 100 percent certain.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/us/photos/36186/margot-robbie-s-barbie-inspired-fashion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Margot Robbie&#8217;s Barbie-Inspired Fashion</a></p>



<p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1381771/inside-margot-robbie-and-tom-ackerleys-dreamy-love-story?query=margot%2520robbie%2520tom%2520ackerley" target="_blank">duo&#8217;s love story</a> dates more than a decade when Robbie, 34, first met Ackerley, 34, on the set of the 2014&#8217;s &#8220;Suite Française&#8221; (she starred alongside <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1394904/katie-holmes-and-michelle-williams-reunion-may-make-you-cry-dawson-style?query=michelle%2520williams" target="_blank">Michelle Williams</a> while he worked behind the scenes as the movie&#8217;s third assistant director). And while, for her, the spark was instant, she was convinced the crush was one-sided.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was always in love with him, but I thought, ‘Oh, he would never love me back,'&#8221; Robbie admitted to <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/margot-robbie-june-cover-wolf-of-wall-street-jane-legend-of-tarzan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a> in 2016. &#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t make it weird, Margot. Don&#8217;t be stupid and tell him that you like him.&#8217; And then it happened, and I was like, ‘Of course we&#8217;re together. This makes so much sense, the way nothing has ever made sense before.'&#8221;</p>



<p>And for the pair — who wed in 2016 — they are not just partners in life and soon-to-be parenthood. Alongside friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr, Robbie and Ackerley run LuckyChap Entertainment, which is behind several acclaimed films including her movies &#8220;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/898623/margot-robbie-on-the-challenges-of-playing-tonya-harding-in-i-tonya?query=i%2520tonya" target="_blank">I, Tonya&#8221;</a> and &#8220;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1390468/margot-robbie-has-a-surprising-answer-on-what-she-took-from-barbie-set?query=barbie" target="_blank">Barbie</a>.&#8221; </p>



<p>But amid a busy life in Hollywood, she prefers to keep her relationship <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1373960/margot-robbie-and-husband-tom-ackerley-step-out-for-rare-date-night-at-chanel-cruise-show?query=margot%2520robbie%2520relationship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of the spotlight</a>. In fact, when it comes to describing her husband, &#8220;<a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1393103/why-margot-robbie-feels-so-lucky-to-be-married-to-normie-tom-ackerley?query=margot%2520robbie%2520relationship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">normie</a>&#8221; is her top pick due to his attitude towards celebrity life. &#8220;I am so lucky,&#8221; Robbie told E! News at the <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1392934/critics-choice-awards-2024-red-carpet-fashion-see-every-look-as-the-stars-arrive?query=margot%2520robbie%2520critics%2520choice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2024 Critics Choice Awards</a>. &#8220;He likes being behind the camera. He&#8217;s not fazed by any of this stuff.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just the best, it&#8217;s so fun,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I love the word &#8216;normie,&#8217; yes, like all my friends, everyone&#8217;s like, &#8216;That&#8217;s cool what you do but it&#8217;s more fun just to hang out and talk about other stuff.&#8217; And you&#8217;re like, &#8216;I know.'&#8221;</p>

<p>Brad Pitt&#8217;s movie about <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/formula-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Formula 1</a> coming to cinemas next year will simply be called “F1,” the racing series said Friday.</p>



<p>Seven-time F1 champion <a href="https://apnews.com/article/brad-pitt-f1-british-gp-hamilton-ac1733107ffeeaa76980ed0a4084c9d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lewis Hamilton</a> is a co-producer of the project, which collected footage at several F1 circuits around the world this year and last.</p>

<p>Country singer <a href="https://www.zachbryan.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.zachbryan.com/">Zach Bryan&#8217;s</a> highly-anticipated new album &#8220;The Great American Bar Scene&#8221; is officially out, and if you take a listen you might notice a few references to Philadelphia. </p>



<p>One of the songs titled &#8220;American Nights&#8221; has several references to the City of Brotherly Love. </p>



<p>Bryan &#8211; who is originally from Oklahoma &#8211; mentions Rivers Casino, Point Breeze and Delaware County. </p>







<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Bryan has showed love to Philadelphia. Last month, he announced ahead of the album release he would be giving select bars across the country early access to the music and among the list was <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/zach-bryan-new-album-release-philadelphia-mcglincheys/3891434/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/zach-bryan-new-album-release-philadelphia-mcglincheys/3891434/">Philadelphia&#8217;s McGlinchey&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania-based snack company revealed three new <a href="https://www.herrs.com/the-latest/flavored-by-philly-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Flavored by Philly” chip flavor finalists</a> on Monday, June 17, 2024.</p>



<p>&#8220;Building on the resounding success of year two of the contest, Herr&#8217;s is once again putting the focus on the local small businesses that infuse Philadelphia with its distinctive culinary character through the Flavored by Philly Local Eats contest,&#8221; the Nottingham-based snack food company <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.herrs.com/the-latest/flavored-by-philly-4/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.herrs.com/the-latest/flavored-by-philly-4/" target="_blank">said in a news release</a>. &#8220;The Flavored by Philly contest celebrates Philadelphia&#8217;s unique flavors, a testament to community support, and a platform for creating cherished snack-time memories.&#8221;</p>

<p>Summer has yet to arrive, but the favorite cheap eats program of the Philadelphia region and beyond is back a bit early with <a href="https://www.wawa.com/hoagiefest" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wawa.com/hoagiefest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wawa Hoagiefest</a>.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wawa.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wawa.com/" target="_blank">Wawa</a>&#8216;s cheap eats program for 2024 features some new &#8220;Classics&#8221; inspired by Philadelphia Eagles legend Jason Kelce and his wife, Kylie Kelce.</p>



<p>Here is the full scoop on the $5 and $6 sandwiches you can start ordering on June 17, 2024:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>When is Wawa Hoagiefest 2024?</strong></h2>



<p>Wawa surprised people Monday morning by announcing that Hoagiefest is here again.</p>



<p>&#8220;This promotion runs from Monday, June 17 through Sunday, August 11 in all Wawa stores and on the Wawa App and provides great savings for an additional four weeks this summer,&#8221; <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/wawa-kentico-prod/wawa/media/press-releases/2024-wawa-hoagiefest_final.pdf?ext=.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://s3.amazonaws.com/wawa-kentico-prod/wawa/media/press-releases/2024-wawa-hoagiefest_final.pdf?ext=.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wawa said in a news release</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>How much do Wawa hoagies cost during Hoagiefest?</strong></h2>



<p>A 6-inch Shorti hoagie will cost just $5 this summer, while a 10-inch Classic hoagie costs $6.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hoagiefest is an annual summer tradition that celebrates the role hoagies have in helping make memories for families whether it’s at graduation parties, beach, concerts and more,&#8221; Wawa chief marketing officer Jim Morey said. &#8220;With the help of Jason and Kylie Kelce, Hoagiefest just got a little more fun thanks to &#8216;Kelce Classics,&#8217; and hopefully customers get a kick out of ordering hoagies just the way they do!&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Hold on, how are Kylie and Jason Kelce involved in the 2024 Wawa Hoagiefest?</strong></h2>



<p>&#8220;During the summer campaign, customers can order their hoagies the way former Philadelphia Eagles’ Center Jason Kelce and Delaware County native Kylie Kelce do,&#8221; Wawa said.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Jason&#8221; is an Italian hoagie with mayo, provolone, tomato and banana peppers on a white roll, Wawa said. </p>



<p>The &#8220;Kylie&#8221; hoagie features honey turkey with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles and banana peppers on a wheat roll.</p>



<p>The Kelces even put out a video promoting Hoagiefest:</p>







<p>“It’s frickin’ Hoagiefest and we couldn’t be more excited to partner with Wawa on their beloved summer tradition of spreading happiness in Philly and beyond,&#8221; Jason and Kylie Kelce said. &#8220;It’s our favorite time of year and we’re hoping &#8216;The Jason,&#8217; and &#8216;The Kylie,&#8217; Kelce Classics make your summer that much brighter!&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>When did Hoagiefest begin?</strong></h2>



<p>&#8220;Summer time&#8217;s here and it&#8217;s Hoagiefest&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The catchy summer food discount featuring catchy jingles and colorful advertising dates back to 2008, Wawa said. &#8220;It has since grown to become an annual celebration of Hoagies.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Want to show off your Hoagiefest pride?</strong></h2>



<p>&#8220;Customers can visit Wawa’s social media channels on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wawa" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/wawa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wawa" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/wawa">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wawa?lang=en" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@wawa?lang=en">Tik Tok</a> from 6/20 – 6/23 for a chance to win Hoagiefest swag perfect for summer including a towel, bucket hat, koozie and t-shirt,&#8221; Wawa said.</p>



<p>Wawa also normally puts the swag up <a href="https://store.wawa.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://store.wawa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for sale on its website</a>.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Hollywood’s summer movie anxieties gave way to joy this weekend with the massive debut of Disney and Pixar’s “ Inside Out 2.” The animated sequel earned $155 million in ticket sales from 4,440 theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday.</p>



<p>Not only is it the second-highest opening weekend in Pixar’s 29 years of making films and the second-biggest animated opening ever (behind only the $182.7 million launch of “Incredibles 2” in 2018); It’s also the biggest of 2024, and since “Barbie.” With an estimated $140 million from international showings, “Inside Out 2” had a staggering, and record-breaking, $295 million global start.</p>



<p>Tony Chambers, who heads theatrical distribution for Disney, was confident that the film would do “extremely well.” But even he was surprised at how much it exceeded already high expectations. </p>



<p>“People go to the theaters for great movies,” Chambers said. “The reviews, the word of mouth just helped build this momentum … It’s becoming a bit of a phenomenon.”</p>



<p>Importantly, “Inside Out 2” audiences spanned ages and all demographics. Post-COVID, he said, breakout successes depend on attracting multicultural audiences.</p>



<p>The success is significant for Pixar, marking a much-needed return to form for a studio that has had a string of underwhelming launches including “ Elemental,” which did eventually become a success, and “ Lightyear,” which didn’t. It’s also vitally important for the greater Hollywood ecosystem and the health of theatrical exhibition, which had been running at a 26% deficit. </p>



<p>“Everybody needed this because success begets success,” said Chambers, who has been getting excited calls from exhibitors and fellow studios alike. “It’s great for the industry, great for Pixar and great for the business overall.”</p>



<p>Disney was already having a good summer, with “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” which this weekend was in third place in its sixth weekend with $5.2 million (bringing its global total to $374.5 million). And next up is “ Deadpool &amp; Wolverine ” (July 26).</p>



<p>Kelsey Mann directed “Inside Out 2,” which picks up with Riley as she turns 13. That means the arrival of new emotions like Anxiety (Maya Hawke) and Envy ( Ayo Edebiri ) to Joy&#8217;s (Amy Poehler) party. It got glowing reviews from critics (92% on Rotten Tomatoes) and polled audiences who gave it an A CinemaScore, suggesting that this won’t be a first-weekend wonder. With kids out of school and an open market until “Despicable Me 4” enters the ring over the Fourth of July, “Inside Out 2” is just getting started.</p>



<p>“This is a monumental weekend for movie theaters,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.</p>



<p>“Inside Out 2” is estimated to have cost around $200 million to produce, which does not account for the millions spent on marketing. Going into the weekend, it was tracking for a debut in the $90 million range, which would have been in line with “Inside Out’s” first weekend in June 2019. Even that would have been considered a terrific achievement, and enough to claim the biggest opening of the year — finally unseating March releases like “ Dune: Part Two ” and “ Godzilla x Kong.”</p>



<p>“For the entire industry that works for theatrical, this is a huge turning point for 2024,” said Daniel Loria of Boxoffice Pro. “This is the sort of weekend we’ve been waiting for.”</p>



<p>As the only major release of the weekend, its theatrical footprint was equally impressive playing on 400 IMAX screens, over 900 “premium large format” screens and over 2,500 3D screens. </p>



<p>This recommitment to theatrical comes after Disney sent several Pixar films straight to its streaming service, Disney+, over the pandemic including “Soul,” “Luca” and “Turning Red.” Last month, the New York Times reported that Pixar had decided to return its focus to feature films (and not producing shows for Disney+) and that it had laid off 14% of its workforce (about 175 employees). </p>



<p>“As important as this weekend is for the industry at large, for Pixar this is huge. They’ve been trying to get their groove back since the pandemic,” Dergarabedian said. “They’ve really come back big.”</p>



<p>Second place went to Sony&#8217;s “ Bad Boys: Ride or Die, ” now in its second weekend with $33 million, down only 42% from its opening. In just 12 days, it&#8217;s already earned over $112 million domestically and $214 million globally. As of Friday, the four-film franchise had crossed the $1 billion mark. </p>



<p>“Bad Boys&#8217;” success last weekend was the start of a higher-earning turnaround for the lagging summer movie season. For Hollywood, the summer season, which runs from the first weekend in May through Labor Day, usually represents about 40% of the yearly box office. The deficit is still significant, with ticket sales down 28% for the summer and 24% for the year (and this is still before “Barbenheimer”) but it&#8217;s progress in a more promising direction nonetheless. </p>



<p>“We&#8217;re not going to get there overnight,” Dergarabedian said. “But it’s good news for theaters. And we have some big movies on the way.”</p>



<p>On the ground, theater owners saw their cineplexes come to life this weekend. </p>



<p>“It has been magical,” said Jeff Whipple, a vice president for Megaplex Theaters. “We have seen literally generations of families brought together for this movie.”</p>



<p>Megaplex Theaters operates 15 locations and 173 screens in Utah and Southern Nevada. And the energy was palpable, Whipple said. Not only have families been hanging around after the showtimes to discuss the film; They’ve also been scoping out what’s coming next with kids taking pictures of the “Despicable Me 4” posters and displays and dads taking note of the “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine” date.</p>



<p>“I think word is going to spread on this film and help draw people into theaters throughout the summer,&#8221; Whipple said. </p>



<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. </p>



<p>1. “Inside Out 2,” $155 million.</p>



<p>2. “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” $33 million.</p>



<p>3. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” $5.2 million.</p>



<p>4. “The Garfield Movie,” $5 million.</p>



<p>5. “The Watchers,” $3.7 million.</p>



<p>6. “IF,” $3.5 million.</p>



<p>7. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” $2.4 million.</p>



<p>8. “The Fall Guy,” $1.5 million.</p>



<p>9. “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” $760,000.</p>



<p>10. “Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,” $632,910.</p>

<p>“The Outsiders,” a gritty adaptation of the classic young adult novel, became the essence of a Broadway insider on Sunday, winning the Tony Award for best new musical on a night when women made strides.</p>

<p>The musical based on the beloved S. E. Hinton book is about rival gangs of haves and have-nots in 1960s Oklahoma. The win meant Angelina Jolie, a producer, landed her first Tony, too.</p>

<p>Producer Matthew Rego, in his acceptance speech, thanked Hinton, in the audience at Manhattan&#8217;s Lincoln Center: “Susie, I’m here to tell you that your story and its eternal message of love and family and staying gold has forever changed all of our lives.”</p>

<p>“Stereophonic,” the play about a Fleetwood Mac-like band recording an album over a turbulent and life-changing year, won best new play and had the night&#8217;s most total awards at five. It was written by David Adjmi, with songs by former Arcade Fire member Will Butler.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. My agent gave me a beta blocker, but it&#8217;s not working,” Adjmi said. He added the play took 11 years to manifest. </p>

<p>“This was a very hard journey to get up here,” he said. “We need to fund the arts in America.”</p>

<p>Two special guests electrified the crowd — Jay-Z and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The latter, a producer of a musical about suffragettes, presented “Suffs.” </p>

<p>“I have stood on a lot of stages, but this is very special,” Clinton said. “I know a little bit about how hard it is to make change.”</p>

<p>In the first musical presentation, Alicia Keys appeared at a piano as the cast of her semi-autobiographical musical, “Hell’s Kitchen,” presented a medley of songs. She sang her and Jay-Z’s 2009 smash “Empire State of Mind,” joining the rapper on interior steps to wild applause. </p>

<p>Later, newcomer Maleah Joi Moon won best leading actress for “Hell&#8217;s Kitchen,” brushing aside a challenge from veteran Kelli O’Hara. The 21-year-old, who plays a role loosely based on Keys’ life, dedicated her award to her parents.</p>

<p>Danya Taymor — whose aunt is Julie Taymor, the first woman to win a Tony Award for directing a musical — became the sixth woman to win the same award for “The Outsiders.”</p>

<p>Then Shaina Taub, only the second woman in Broadway history to write, compose and star in a Broadway musical, won for best score, the ninth woman to do so. The “Suffs” creator had already won for best book earlier in the night.</p>

<p>“If you are inspired by the story of ‘Suffs,’ please make sure you and everyone you know have registered to vote and vote, vote, vote!” she said. Taub said the win was for all the loud girls out there: “Go for it.” </p>

<p>Jeremy Strong took home the first big award of the night. The “Succession” star landed his first Tony for his work in the revival of Henrik Ibsen’s 1882 political play “An Enemy of the People.” The award for best lead actor in a play will sit next to his Emmy, Screen Actors Guild Award and Golden Globe.</p>

<p>Kara Young, the first Black performer to be nominated for a Tony three consecutive years in a row, won this time as best featured actress in a play for “Purlie Victorious,” the story of a Black preacher’s plan to reclaim his inheritance and win back his church from a plantation owner. </p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you to my ancestors,&#8221; she said, giving thanks to a list that included playwright Ossie Davis and co-star Ruby Dee, who originated her role.</p>

<p>“Harry Potter” star Daniel Radcliffe cemented his stage career pivot by winning featured actor in a musical, his first trophy in five Broadway shows. He won for the revival of “Merrily We Roll Along,” the Stephen Sondheim- George Furth musical that goes backward in time.</p>

<p>“This is one of the best experiences of my life,” Radcliffe said. “I will never have it as good again.” He also thanked his parents for playing Sondheim in the car growing up. </p>

<p>“Merrily” was also named best musical revival and earned Jonathan Groff his first Tony, for leading actor in a musical. Groff — previously nominated for “Spring Awakening” and “Hamilton” — thanked co-stars Lindsay Mendez and Radcliffe, both emotional in the audience.</p>

<p>Groff, who said he used to watch the Tonys in Pennsylvania as a kid, also thanked his parents and brother for letting him act out scenes from “I Love Lucy” as a child. </p>

<p>“Thank you for always allowing my freak flag to fly without ever making me feel weird about it,” he said.</p>

<p>Kecia Lewis, who plays a formidable piano teacher in “Hell’s Kitchen,” took home her first Tony, too. The 40-year veteran made her Broadway debut at 18 in the original company of “Dreamgirls.”</p>

<p>“This moment is the one I dreamed of for those 40 years,” she said. “Don’t give up!”</p>

<p>“Appropriate,” Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ show centered on a family reunion in Arkansas, was named best play revival. Jacobs-Jenkins also thanked Davis, saying there would be no “Appropriate” without “Purlie Victorious.”</p>

<p>“Appropriate” star Sarah Paulson added a best leading actress in a play Tony to her awards cabinet. Paulson said she was thrilled to be able to interrogate the human condition: “This is the heart and soul of what we do and I am so honored to be amongst you.”</p>

<p>Three-time Tony-honored Chita Rivera got a special tribute from Audra McDonald, Brian Stokes Mitchell and Bebe Neuwirth. Images of her work in “Chicago,” “Kiss of the Spider Woman” and “West Side Story” were projected while dancers performed her hit numbers. Host Ariana DeBose, who won an Oscar in Rivera’s “West Side Story” role of Anita, joined in.</p>

<p>DeBose, a three-time host, also co-choreographed the opening original number, “This Party’s for You.” The song cheered those who sacrifice for their art and took a gentle swipe at other entertainment types: “You’ll learn that film and TV can make you rich and make you famous. But theater will make you better.”</p>

<p>The performances also included an intense, creepy version of “Willkommen” from the “Cabaret” revival led by Eddie Redmayne, Pete Townshend playing guitar for “The Who’s Tommy” and a messy rumble from “The Outsiders” that included falling water, buckets of dirt, various carpets and an onstage truck. </p>

<p>The telecast teased upcoming shows, inviting Nicole Scherzinger — slated to star in a “Sunset Boulevard” revival — to sing the “In Memoriam” section. Nick Jonas and Adrienne Warren — announced today as stars of 2025&#8217;s “The Last Five Years” — presented.</p>

<p>Scherzinger sang “What I Did for Love” as the names appeared, including playwright Christopher Durang and actors Alan Arkin,Glenda Jackson,Louis Gossett Jr., and Treat Williams.</p>
