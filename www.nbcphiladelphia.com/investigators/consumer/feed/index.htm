<p>More than half of Americans plan to host guests for Thanksgiving this year. NBC10 Responds is helping you manage your money with tips on cutting down on the cost of dinner.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/study/thanksgiving-cost-report/">A new survey from LendingTree</a> reports Thanksgiving hosting duties this year could cost an average of $431 for food, drinks and décor, a 19% increase compared to last year.</p>



<p><strong><em><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/">Léelo en españo</a><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">l</a><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/"> aquí</a></em></strong></p>



<p>“Even though inflation is slowing down, prices aren’t falling,” Matt Schultz, Chief Credit Analyst at LendingTree, told NBC10. “And I think that that’s probably going to have an impact on how people approach Thanksgiving.”</p>



<p>Schultz said the right credit card – used wisely – can make a difference when shopping for Thanksgiving dinner. He advises shoppers to look for signup bonuses or cash back offers.</p>



<p>“If you already have money saved back for the holidays, instead of paying for everything around Thanksgiving or Christmas with cash, get a new credit card,” Schultz said. “Use that card to the amount that it takes to get that $100 or $200 signup bonus and then use the cash you have in savings to pay off that card.”</p>



<p>Around 60% of Thanksgiving hosts expect their guests to offer money or an item to help offset expenses.</p>



<p>“Don&#8217;t be afraid to be a little bit vulnerable and say, you know, I&#8217;m trying to pay down debt so things are a little more difficult,” Schultz said. “Would it be okay if instead of pitching in financially, maybe I show up a little earlier and help decorate or help more with the food? Getting creative with those sorts of things can help you keep your costs down.”</p>



<p>Schultz also recommends shopping around.</p>



<p>“If you’re willing to maybe venture away from the typical grocery store that you go to or your favorite other types of retailers, you may be able to find some deals that help you keep those costs down,” Schultz said.</p>



<p>Schultz also said to stick to a plan and a list wherever you end up shopping.</p>



<p>“Not necessarily knowing what they&#8217;re looking for and just kind of looking for inspiration,” Schultz said. “And they end up giving in to impulse and kind of wrecking their budget that way.”</p>



<p>Remember to also research different deals or perks your grocery store offers during the holidays, including Thanksgiving meal packages for certain group sizes.</p>

<p>“Tracy&#8217;s signature on her email isn&#8217;t merely who she is and what she does and who she works for, She shares. Here to serve. That is particularly distinctive and I suspect that is extraordinarily distinctive in her fast paced world of work<em>.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s how Manor College President Dr. Jonathan Peri spoke of NBC10 Responds reporter and news anchor Tracy Davidson as she was honored at the 23rd Annual Evening with Manor event at Jenkintown&#8217;s <a href="https://manor.edu/" data-type="link" data-id="https://manor.edu/">Manor College</a> on Nov. 15, 2024.</p>



<p>Manor honored Tracy for leading “an incredible life off camera with a mission to serve others.”</p>



<p>“Her focus is empowering women and girls, both professionally and personally,” the Montgomery County college said.</p>



<p>Tracy addresd the crowd.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not helpless to bring hope and help to the people right in front of us every day, to the community in front of us, every day, to the culture that we live in every day,&#8221; Tracy told the crowd.</p>



<p>Thursday&#8217;s event &#8220;raises money for Manor College’s mission – personalized education that generates a commitment to a peaceful world,&#8221; the college said. </p>



<p>The fundraiser drew a record 150 attendees and raised more than $100,000, the college said. NBC10&#8217;s Sheila Watko served as emcee and several of Sheila&#8217;s and Tracy&#8217;s colleagues attended.</p>



<p>Tracy offered advice on being a light to others.</p>



<p>&#8220;“It takes intention and attention in our scrambled, hectic world,&#8221; Tracy said. &#8220;And trust me when I tell you I am scrambled most of the time. If we can give our attention and remember that we have the opportunity to change the culture and to change the community right in front of us by letting people know, I see you and I&#8217;m here to help you tonight.&#8221;</p>



<p>Congrats Tracy on a well-earned honor.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (DHS) is warning residents of a scam targeting millions of people in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits as well as others.</p>



<p>The scammers have sent text messages that claim a SNAP recipient’s EBT card has been deactivated and directs them to call a number. The messages have also been sent to people who are not SNAP recipients.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/acusan-novio-kaiheem-jerelle-williams-matar-novia-embarazada-lansdowne-pensilvania/2445720/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Léelo en español aquí.</a></p>



<p>“If someone is claiming to be from or affiliated with the Department and they are asking you for your personal information, it is a scam,” Pennsylvania DHS Secretary Dr. Val Arkoosh wrote in a statement.</p>



<p>Dr. Arkoosh said the DHS will never ask for personal information in an unsolicited text message, email or phone call.</p>



<p>The DHS also said it would never ask for the following details in a text message:</p>



<ul>
<li>Details about a person’s benefits, such as the amount of SNAP they are authorized to receive</li>



<li>A request for specific personal information</li>



<li>A request to visit links to unofficial websites. Most DHS texts will direct people to a .gov or .org site</li>
</ul>



<p>The Pennsylvania DHS will only reach out to people who receive SNAP, Medicaid and other benefits from the following number: 1-833-648-1964.</p>



<p>Anyone who wants to confirm if a call, text, email or any communication is legitimate can reach out to the following resources:</p>



<ul>
<li>NJ Food Stamps Fraud Line: 1-800-792-9773, option 5</li>

<p>Black Friday is more than two weeks away but retailers are already slashing prices with some deals that were offered as early as October. With so many deals coming and going, NBC10 Responds spoke with an expert about the best time to buy.</p>



<p>“All of these early Black Friday sales can be confusing for shoppers because the risk is that you buy something and it falls in price later,” <a href="https://www.retailmenot.com/shop/deals/black-friday" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.retailmenot.com/shop/deals/black-friday">Stephanie Carls of RetailMeNot</a> told NBC10.</p>



<p>RetailMeNot applies coupons and cash back for retail websites. Carls told NBC10 shoppers should start looking into Black Friday deals now. She also said many of the same deals will be available on the actual day.</p>



<p>“You can feel confident that you’ll see that same thing from that merchant or a different one on Black Friday itself,” Carls said.</p>



<p>Carls also said there are always exceptions however, and shoppers should jump quickly when they see a deal on toys.</p>



<p>“Those are probably one of the most popular things for Christmas,” she said. “So if you do see one that you’ve been looking for in stock when Black Friday sales kick off, add it to your cart right away and don’t put that purchase off.”</p>



<p>Carls also said televisions are products shoppers should buy in person on Black Friday.</p>



<p>“You’re going to find some of the best deals in the form of doorbuster prices on television,” she said.</p>



<p>Carls also warned not to just go for the cheapest TV available, however.</p>



<p>“Do your research to get the highest quality set instead,” she said.</p>



<p>If you miss Black Friday deal dates, you should also look out for Cyber Monday deals as well. Finally, if you’re stuck on picking the perfect present, Carls said gift cards are the number one sought after gift to purchase for the holidays this year.</p>



<p>“This is going to be one that you want to pay attention to for Black Friday because you’ll see different retailers like Amazon, Target, some fashion retailers,” she said. “They offer deals on their own gift cards or deals on gift cards for other brands and services.”</p>



<p>See the full list and calendar of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals below.</p>

<p>These days, it&#8217;s easy for anyone to take out their phones and scan a QR Code to see a food menu or to pay a bill.</p>



<p>But, QR Codes can also make it easy for scammers to access your personal information. The NBC10 Responds team has some tips to help you spot the red flags so you don&#8217;t become a victim the next time you see those digital barcodes.</p>



<p>In a recent survey, 83% of people in September said that they used a QR Code for a financial transaction in the past three months. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all&#038;strip=all&#038;resize=1920%2C1080" alt="" class="wp-image-9971568" srcset="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1920&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=218&amp;strip=all 218w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=300&amp;strip=all 300w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=768&amp;strip=all 768w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1536&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=850&amp;strip=all 850w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=600&amp;strip=all 600w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=500&amp;strip=all 500w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=400&amp;strip=all 400w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320&amp;strip=all 320w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=200&amp;strip=all 200w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/10/scan-to-pay.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=100&amp;strip=all 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>&#8220;QR Codes can be extremely dangerous, can end up being financial loss, personal information theft, any kind of attack related to them,&#8221; Iskander Sanchez-Rola, of Gen Digital, told NBC10 Responds. </p>



<p>Gen Digital is a cybersecurity software company, and Sanchez-Rola says that everyone needs to be vigilant of suspicious QR Code behavior. </p>



<p>Suspicious behavior could include a fake code covering up the real code, like a sticker. </p>



<p>One example happened recently near the city of Los Angeles, California, when a beach town warned visitors after about 150 parking meters were discovered to have fake QR Code stickers posted over the real ones in August. </p>



<p>&#8220;So you have to look for things or hints that tell you that has been tampered. Like, maybe, it looks like a sticker on top of something that is not the same,&#8221; Sanchez-Rola explained. </p>



<p>To avoid a parking meter QR Code scam, or any other variations of the scam, Sanchez-Rola says to rely on trusted sources.</p>



<p>If you have the option to pay with a debit or credit car at a physical parking meter, use that instead of scanning a code.</p>



<p>Sanchez-Rola says that we all need to think twice when scanning a QR Code that prompts us to share information in order to use their service, including your phone number or email address.</p>



<p>&#8220;So you give all that information and then they can use this information for whatever they want,&#8221; Sanchez-Rola said.</p>



<p>Not only should you verify a URL that a QR Code takes you to, but verify any app that the code prompts you to download.</p>



<p>&#8220;Once they have you instaling on the phone they have control of everything that is in the phone,&#8221; Sanchez-Rola explained. </p>



<p>He also said that there is a <a href="https://us.norton.com/products/genie-scam-detector" data-type="link" data-id="https://us.norton.com/products/genie-scam-detector" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free app that analyzes QR Codes</a>, text messages, website or social posts to see if it is a scam called &#8220;Genie.&#8221;</p>



<p>Genie is run by the same company that owns Gen Digitial, Norton. </p>



<p>If you think you are the victim of an identity crime, you can call or text toll-free 888-400-5530.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also visit the ID Theft Center website by <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clicking here</a>. </p>

<p>Women in the Philadelphia area are warning others about emails from scammers claiming to have compromising photos of them and threatening to extort them while showing photos of homes they used to live in. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Kierra Howell told NBC10 she was scrolling through her inbox when she noticed an email from an unfamiliar sender.</p>



<p>“I opened it up and it’s just like this long message saying they tracked my phone. They could see inside my camera, watch what I’ve been doing, and like, sent a picture of the front of my old place,” she said.</p>



<p>Howell said the sender demanded $1950 in bitcoin and threatened to send revealing footage of her to others if she didn’t pay.</p>



<p>“It was like a little scary,” Howell said.</p>



<p>Lindsey Clark told NBC10 she also received a similar email from someone claiming they knew where she lived, showing a street view of a home and threatening to release compromising videos of her.</p>



<p><a href="https://drexel.edu/coas/faculty-research/faculty-directory/criminology-justice-studies/dovidio-robert/" data-type="link" data-id="https://drexel.edu/coas/faculty-research/faculty-directory/criminology-justice-studies/dovidio-robert/">Rob D’Ovidio</a>, Associate Professor of Criminology and Justice Studies at Drexel University, told NBC10 both women were the target of what the security industry is referring to as “The Google Street View Scam.”</p>



<p>D’Ovidio said the scammers claim they have intimate pictures in order to scare and intimidate people into sending them money. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the ways to distinguish between the scam and the real case of sextortion is that they’re going to give you some sort of evidence of what they have in order to force that payment,” D’Ovidio said.</p>



<p>D’Ovidio told NBC10 there’s a quick way to check any suspicious email you receive.</p>



<p>“Take snippets from that email, copy it, put it into Google,” D’Ovidio said. “See if other people are getting the same email. If you find that’s the case, if the search results tell you that’s the case, chances are it’s not legitimate.”</p>



<p>NBC10 copied and pasted parts of the emails Howell and Clark received into a Google search. The results showed a warning from Maryland State Police about the same type of email. A post on a Philadelphia-based Facebook page also showed others were getting the same message. Dozens of replies speculated about how the emails landed in their inbox.</p>



<p>“It was to my personal email with my phone number. But it was actually addressed to one of my friends that lives in Boston, Massachusetts,” Clark said.</p>



<p>As Clark tried to make sense of it all, she noticed someone in the comments asking if receivers of the email had ordered from the Philadelphia-based <a href="https://dibruno.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://dibruno.com/">Di Bruno Bros.</a></p>



<p>“And then it clicked for me because my friend got engaged in 2022 and I sent her one of their gift boxes as like a congratulations,” she said.</p>



<p>Howell told NBC10 her email has been on Di Bruno’s mailing list for about five years.</p>



<p>“I haven’t gotten anything delivered from them,” Howell said. “It’s been like a good amount of time.”</p>



<p>Another person told NBC10 she and her fiancé both got the same threatening email. But instead of their address, it showed the home of their future in-laws. The couple said they used Di Bruno Bros. to send gift boxes in December 2021.</p>



<p>NBC10 reached out to the company for comment.</p>



<p>“The Di Bruno Bros. company was acquired by DB Gourmet Markets LLC in 2024. We recently became aware of this matter when our customers reached out to us,” a spokesperson told us. “Although our investigation into this issue is ongoing, we believe customers’ email addresses may have been obtained as the result of a data breach of a third-party service provider that occurred in 2023. The third-party, retained by the previous ownership to conduct a security audit, had experienced the data breach.”</p>



<p>NBC10 also reached out to the previous owners of Di Bruno Bros. They did not want to comment and referred us back to the new owner’s statement.</p>



<p>When we asked Di Bruno Bros. to tell us more about the possible data breach and the third party involved, a spokesperson would not elaborate.</p>



<p>Clark, meanwhile, is trying to warn others about the scam.</p>



<p>“I may have been aware that this is spam,” she said. “But for the countless other people that may have felt fear or shame and just felt like, ‘I need to pay this to get it to stop.’ And it’s just like, you’re taking advantage of people.”</p>



<p>If you’ve received a similar scam email, <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/">report it to the FBI tip website here.</a></p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Pumpkins, skeletons, witches and ghouls, there’s no doubt that spooky season is upon us and Halloween will be here before you know it.</p>



<p>All that candy, decorations and costumes can add up.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nrf.com/research-insights/holiday-data-and-trends/halloween" data-type="link" data-id="https://nrf.com/research-insights/holiday-data-and-trends/halloween" target="_blank">According to the National Retail Federation</a>, people plan to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nearly-half-halloween-shoppers-start-purchasing-items-october" data-type="link" data-id="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nearly-half-halloween-shoppers-start-purchasing-items-october" target="_blank">spend more than $100</a> to celebrate the spooky season.</p>



<p>Luckily, NBC10 Responds has your guide to make the cost of getting in the Halloween spirit a little less scary.</p>



<p>A good bet to finding that perfect Halloween costume could be hitting up your local thrift store. The lead-up to Halloween is a busy time at secondhand stores, Goodwill of Delaware and Delaware County CEO Colleen Morrone said.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve got great prices on putting together a Halloween costume at a low cost,&#8221; Morrone said. &#8220;And, you have a one-of-a-kind costume.”</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s so much more you can do at Goodwill for Halloween &#8212; or any costume that you&#8217;re making &#8212; in that you&#8217;re going to find pieces that look similar to what you&#8217;re doing and be able to work with it,” shopper Tabitha said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>What are the top Halloween costumes this year?</strong></h2>



<p>The top adult costumes this year are expected to be a witch, vampire and cat.</p>



<p>Tabitha can relate: “One of the last dresses I made from here, it was a witch costume actually for Halloween. And, it looked similar to what I needed… it was perfect.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>According to the Federal Trade Commission, romance scammers stole $1.14 billion from Americans just last year. Yet experts say the amount may even be higher than that because many victims are too embarrassed to report the crimes as criminals get better and better.</p>



<p>NBC10 Responds spoke with one victim from the Philadelphia area who wanted to share her story, however.</p>



<p>Kate Kleinert told NBC10 it started back in 2020 when she was browsing Facebook and a man named “Tony” sent her a friend request. Kleinert’s husband had passed 12 years prior.</p>



<p>“I never, ever, ever accept those friend requests,” she said. “But for some reason, just one day I did.”</p>



<p>Tony was a handsome man who said he was a surgeon who was working on a contract with the United Nations in Iraq.</p>



<p>“And he had read my profile on Facebook, liked dogs, liked gardening, liked all the things that I liked and wanted to get to know me better,” Kleinert said.</p>



<p>A few days after meeting each other, Tony asked Kleinert to move to what is now known as Google Chat so that they could speak to each other.</p>



<p>“It was just nice having a conversation with the man against just in every day,” she said. “Every night he would call and say, ‘How was your day, honey?’”</p>



<p>After a few months, the conversation between the two turned romantic. Tony then asked Kleinert to send a gift card to his daughter at a boarding school in England. Kleinert figured it would take weeks to send the gift card. Tony told her to take a picture of the front and back of the card and send the picture, however. He then asked for a similar gift for his son as well as gifts for himself.</p>



<p>“There was always a request for Tony,” Kleinert said. “Needed better food where he was. He needed a better signal to be able to call me. He needed to bribe someone to be able to get better food or what have you.”</p>



<p>Kleinert said she sent so much money to Tony that she was having trouble paying her bills.</p>



<p>“My cellphone got turned off every month until I could scrape together money to get it turned back on. And my electricity had been turned off,” she said. “I went through my savings, my 401K, my husband’s, the rest of his life insurance.”</p>



<p>As the amount of money she gave Tony grew, so did their relationship plans.</p>



<p>“The plan was Tony would come here on leave but then put in for his retirement and not go back,” she said. “And we would get married and then we would go get the children and just have this wonderful life together.”</p>



<p>Kleinert said they set December 10, 2020, as the date that they would meet. Tony was supposed to call when he landed at the airport.</p>



<p>“I had a new dress. I did my nails. I redid my nails. I did my hair,” she said.</p>



<p>Tony never arrived, however. Kleinert got a call the next morning from someone who claimed Tony had been arrested at the airport.</p>



<p>“But now they needed bail money to get him out of jail,” she said. “$20,000 they wanted me to hand over. And all I could do was cry because I didn’t even have $20 to my name at that point.”</p>



<p>It was at that moment that Kleinert realized she had been scammed. At that point, she had lost around $39,000.</p>



<p>Kleinert later shared her story with her family as well as law enforcement. She also struggled for years to recover financially, a struggle that was amplified when a portable unit she used to replace her broken air conditioner caught fire in the summer of 2022, destroying all her possessions and killing her six dogs.</p>



<p>Even after that, she said she got another call from Tony, asking her for more money.</p>



<p>Eventually, Kleinert was able to buy a new home in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, using the proceeds from her home insurance. Kleinert currently works with the <a href="https://states.aarp.org/virginia/scam-jam-2023-the-story-of-kate-kleinart#:~:text=The%20total%20amount%20of%20money,Heartbroken%2C%20she%20cried%20for%20weeks.">AARP Fraud Watch Helpline</a> to protect other people from scammers.</p>



<p>“It means a great deal that I can reach out to other people and maybe help one person not fall for the same thing I did,” she said.</p>



<p>As for Tony, Kleinert said she eventually found out he wasn’t a doctor or the man she saw in the picture on Facebook. Instead, he was a 55-year-old Nigerian man.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Tips on protecting yourself from scammers</h2>



<p>Theresa Payton, a cyber security expert, told NBC10 that just about anyone is vulnerable to skilled scammers.</p>



<p>“They could teach a masterclass in human behavior,” Payton said. “How to manipulate. How to build trust.”</p>



<p>Payton believes social media companies should do their part to protect people.</p>



<p>“For example, when they get a friend request, being able to say this account is not very old or this account says they live in America, but it’s Indonesia, like a little checklist before you accept a friend invitation,” Payton said.</p>



<p>Payton said the red flags to look for are if the relationship is escalating quickly or if they ask for money in any form. She also recommended that anyone interacting with a stranger online should put the person’s picture in a reverse image search. If it comes back associated with multiple names and accounts, it’s a scam.</p>



<p>Payton says time is of the essence for victims of scams to minimize their losses. If you or a loved one have been victimized, call your bank first, then law enforcement. <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/">You can also file a report on the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center website.</a></p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has ordered TD Bank to pay $7.76 million to tens of thousands of victims of the bank’s illegal actions.</p>



<p>In a statement released Wednesday, the CFPB claims for years, the bank repeatedly shared inaccurate, negative information about its customers to consumer reporting companies. </p>



<p>The information, the agency said, included &#8220;systemic errors about credit card delinquencies and bankruptcies.&#8221; </p>



<p>In addition to having to pay nearly $8 million to its own customers, the CFPB is ordering TD Bank to pay a $20 million civil money penalty.</p>



<p>“The CFPB’s investigation found that TD Bank illegally threatened the consumer reports of its customers with fraudulent information and then barely lifted a finger to fix it,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra in a statement. “Rather than treating its customers fairly and following the law, TD Bank’s management clearly cared more about growth and expanding its empire through mergers. Regulators will need to focus major attention on TD Bank to change its course.”</p>



<p>The agency said that these kinds of reports &#8212; including credit reports, employment screening reports, tenant screening reports, and other background reports &#8212; are often used by financial institutions, employers, and landlords, among others, to decide whether to extend credit, housing, or employment to a consumer. </p>



<p>The inaccurate information shared by TD Bank related to credit card and bank deposit accounts, including accounts TD Bank knew or suspected were fraudulently opened, the CFPB said. </p>



<p>After the bank realized it was botching its reporting to consumer reporting companies, it took far too long to correct many of its errors, according to the CFPB. </p>



<p>Contacted for comment, TD Bank responded with a statement that read, before the settlement with the CFPB, the bank had already &#8220;implemented enhancements&#8221; to address &#8220;these matters.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;Long before this settlement, TD self-identified these matters and voluntarily and proactively implemented enhancements to our furnishing and dispute handling practices&#8230;&#8221; the statement read, in part. </p>



<p>NBC10 Responds believes this is a lesson for everyone to be sure to check their credit reports on a regular basis. </p>

<p><strong><em>Romance scammers are stealing money from consumers every day, to the tune of $1.1 billion in 2023 alone. Anyone can be a target, no matter their background, including NBC10’s own Tracy Davidson. After one such scammer tried to target her, Tracy decided to share her interaction to expose their methods and help protect others from being scammed. She shares her story below:</em></strong></p>



<p>I honestly didn’t think anything of it when &#8220;James Williams” reached out to me via social media in late February asking, “can I have a conversation with you?”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-2.gif?resize=1200%2C675&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" class="wp-image-9507048" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>I followed him back and sent him a direct message. </p>



<p>&#8220;How can I help you?&#8221; I asked.</p>



<p>“I just want to be friends with you,” he answered. “You look so wonderful and respectable that words just cannot express how beautiful you are.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-3.gif?resize=1200%2C675&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" class="wp-image-9507049" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Flattering. But wow, red flag there. But I played along, just to see where this would take us. I asked the Secret Service to follow along as well. </p>



<p>“Romance scams are pretty prevalent,” Kristie Sandefur, an investigative analyst with the Secret Service in Philadelphia, told NBC10.</p>



<p>Sandefur said the daily interactions that ensued were classic romance scam.</p>



<p>James asked me where I live. He said he was from Seattle but was “currently in Syria working with the United Nations, as a military orthopedic surgeon.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-4.gif?resize=1200%2C675&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" class="wp-image-9507052" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>James said he had one son, Jack. He sent me a picture that showed a man and a teenager in sunglasses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" class="wp-image-9507056" srcset="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=1920&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=218&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 218w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=300&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 300w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=768&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 768w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=1536&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=1200&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=850&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 850w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=600&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 600w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=500&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 500w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=400&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 400w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=320&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 320w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=200&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 200w, https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-Photo-5.png?resize=1920%2C1080&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all?w=100&amp;quality=85&amp;strip=all 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>“This is all a part of that relationship building phase where they’re earning your trust,” Sandefur said. “They’re trying to bring you into their circle. Make you a part of their family.”</p>



<p>Two weeks after our “relationship” began, James professed something to me.</p>



<p>“My feelings for you is growing stronger each day,” he wrote. “I want to talk with you face to face and feel you near me.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-6.gif?resize=1200%2C675&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" class="wp-image-9507058" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>“This is playing out exactly how we would expect it to play out,” Sandefur said.</p>



<p>Sandefur said these romance scams are all according to script and often target people who are lonely.</p>



<p>“One thing to just be aware of is this is these people’s full-time jobs,” Sandefur said. “This is all they do. You know what I mean? They’re essentially chained to a desk for the entire day. They’re given multiple phones. They’re given multiple aliases, identities and they’re you know, told to contact a hundred Americans in a day.”</p>



<p>James told me he had exceeded his vacation limit.</p>



<p>“The only way I can leave camp now and come see you is if you are going to help me and apply for my vacation,” he wrote.</p>



<p>He told me we needed to apply to the United Nations.</p>



<p>“I think he was trying to add some legitimacy by using the United Nations,” Sandefur said. “Clearly not a member of the United Nations.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-7.gif?resize=1200%2C675&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" class="wp-image-9507059" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>James gave me an email address and told me what to say.</p>



<p>“The UN vacation department is going to charge you some money,” he wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-9.gif?resize=1200%2C675&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" class="wp-image-9507061" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Sandefur said that <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/fraud-alert" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/fraud-alert">the United Nations website has a fraud alert</a> to protect people from scammers like James.</p>



<p>I emailed the address that James gave me and received a response that said they received my email requesting the vacation certificate. The response also cited a supposed law stating that I needed to pay $14,000 in U.S. dollars. The reply stated they could accept the payment through bitcoin, bank to bank deposit or bank deposit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-9.5.gif?resize=1200%2C675&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" class="wp-image-9507072" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>“Very typical in non-English speaking countries, you know, fairly confident that person is overseas,” Sandefur said. “And then all the grammatical errors. The domain that that email was sent from is not a United Nations domain.”</p>



<p>I asked where to send the money and I was given bank account information of a woman in Canon City, Colorado.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/05/Romance-Scam-10.gif?resize=1200%2C675&#038;quality=85&#038;strip=all" alt="" class="wp-image-9507086" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>“That person, likely a money mule,” Sandefur said. “Money mules are people that scammers basically recruit to move money for them.”</p>



<p>We called the numbers listed for that woman. Two of those numbers were disconnected. We didn’t hear back from the third number after we left a message.</p>



<p>I never sent any money and I continued to receive daily messages from James. But now I just ignore them. Just like you should from the very beginning.</p>

<p>The FTC also shared additional advice about protecting yourself from romance scams.</p>



<p>Never send money, crypto, gift cards, bank or wire transfers to anyone you’ve never met in person. Be suspicious of excuses for why a real life meeting is impossible. Do a reverse search of any pictures shared. If you see those pictures associated with another name or details don’t match, you’re dealing with a scammer.</p>

<p>More than half of Americans plan to host guests for Thanksgiving this year. NBC10 Responds is helping you manage your money with tips on cutting down on the cost of dinner.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/study/thanksgiving-cost-report/">A new survey from LendingTree</a> reports Thanksgiving hosting duties this year could cost an average of $431 for food, drinks and décor, a 19% increase compared to last year.</p>



<p><strong><em><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/">Léelo en españo</a><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">l</a><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/"> aquí</a></em></strong></p>



<p>“Even though inflation is slowing down, prices aren’t falling,” Matt Schultz, Chief Credit Analyst at LendingTree, told NBC10. “And I think that that’s probably going to have an impact on how people approach Thanksgiving.”</p>



<p>Schultz said the right credit card – used wisely – can make a difference when shopping for Thanksgiving dinner. He advises shoppers to look for signup bonuses or cash back offers.</p>



<p>“If you already have money saved back for the holidays, instead of paying for everything around Thanksgiving or Christmas with cash, get a new credit card,” Schultz said. “Use that card to the amount that it takes to get that $100 or $200 signup bonus and then use the cash you have in savings to pay off that card.”</p>



<p>Around 60% of Thanksgiving hosts expect their guests to offer money or an item to help offset expenses.</p>



<p>“Don&#8217;t be afraid to be a little bit vulnerable and say, you know, I&#8217;m trying to pay down debt so things are a little more difficult,” Schultz said. “Would it be okay if instead of pitching in financially, maybe I show up a little earlier and help decorate or help more with the food? Getting creative with those sorts of things can help you keep your costs down.”</p>



<p>Schultz also recommends shopping around.</p>



<p>“If you’re willing to maybe venture away from the typical grocery store that you go to or your favorite other types of retailers, you may be able to find some deals that help you keep those costs down,” Schultz said.</p>



<p>Schultz also said to stick to a plan and a list wherever you end up shopping.</p>



<p>“Not necessarily knowing what they&#8217;re looking for and just kind of looking for inspiration,” Schultz said. “And they end up giving in to impulse and kind of wrecking their budget that way.”</p>



<p>Remember to also research different deals or perks your grocery store offers during the holidays, including Thanksgiving meal packages for certain group sizes.</p>

<p>Rich Carucci’s livelihood is his North Philadelphia convenience store.</p>



<p>“I’ve been here ten years,” Carucci told NBC10. “I put my life and blood and soul into this business. I’m here all the time.”</p>



<p>That livelihood was being threatened everyday by shoplifters, however.</p>



<p>“We had like, I would say, two or three shoplifters a day,” he said. “I would say we lost upwards of $50,000 to theft. That’s a lot of money. That’s a lot of money coming out of my pocket.”</p>



<p>Carucci was not alone. According to Philadelphia Police, retail theft went up 27.56% in the city in 2023 compared to the previous year.</p>



<p>Carucci told NBC10 he could only watch after security cameras captured a shoplifter stealing from his store. So he started looking into options beyond the cameras he already had in place. His search ultimately led him to a new AI program called <a href="https://veesion.io/en/">“Veesion.”</a></p>



<p>The program’s cofounder, Benoit Koenig, told NBC10 his company feeds businesses’ live security footage into their AI system. The AI then analyzes customers in the store and picks up on certain movements that could suggest someone is stealing. That movement could be something as simple as someone slipping an item into their pocket.</p>



<p>“When someone on the shopping floor conceals an item in clothes, bag, backpack, purse, so that they can actually act on the spot and not just see the damages afterwards,” Koenig said.</p>



<p>NBC10 Responds got a firsthand look at how the program works. One NBC10 Responds producer went down the aisle of Carucci’s store, took some candy off the shelf and put it in her bookbag. Carucci was immediately alerted on his phone.</p>



<p>“Okay, so when you were concealing the item, I immediately, seconds, got the alert,” he said.</p>



<p>The alert went through the Veesion app along with a video of the suspected shoplifter in action.</p>



<p>Carucci said shoplifting has decreased at his store since he installed the device.</p>



<p>“If the theft continues the way it was going, I was either going to have to stop my business, close my business, or the other option I had was to raise the prices,” Carucci said.</p>



<p>Veesion said their AI is only in a few hundred stores across the country. But it’s not the only AI program that’s being used to crackdown on crime.</p>



<p>The Loss Prevention Research Council (LPRC) at the University of Florida is testing different theft prevention measures on a larger scale.</p>



<p>Dr. Read Hayes, the director and founder of the LPRC, said his team is working with 110 tech companies and 88 retailers, including Target and Walmart, to help cut store losses down.</p>



<p>“None of them have told us that shoplifting or theft or losses are down or flat,” Hayes said.</p>



<p>Hayes’ team works in a one-of-a-kind mock store and they’ve conducted hundreds of real world projects with store simulations, multiple surveillance cameras and locking devices for merchandise.</p>



<p>Hayes said they’ve also studied AI as a possible solution.</p>



<p>“There’s AI in here that could pick up if you’re not actually scanning an item at self-checkout,” he said.</p>



<p>Carucci told NBC10 the AI technology is helping him keep more money in his pocket.</p>



<p>“It’s been a godsend and it’s already paid for itself like ten times over,” he said.</p>



<p>Philadelphia Police said retail theft continues to increase in 2024 and is up 30 percent compared to the same time last year.</p>

<p>Eligible Facebook users have only one day left to file a claim in a new nationwide settlement involving the social media giant. </p>



<p>The deadline to file in the $725 million <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/you-have-1-month-left-to-file-a-claim-in-the-nationwide-facebook-settlement/3612150/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">class-action settlement</a> is Aug. 25, 2023.  </p>



<p>The settlement was reached with Facebook&#8217;s parent company, Meta Platforms Inc. following a lawsuit, which alleged Facebook made users&#8217; data available to third parties without their permission and claimed the platform did not monitor or enforce third-party access to the data they received. That includes the collection of data by now-defunct political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which went on to be used for political advertising on the platform.</p>



<p>For those unsure if they are eligible, the eligibility requirements recently changed. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/more-eligible-claim-facebook-settlement-recent-update/3145096/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The guidelines for the settlement were expanded </a>to include even more users. But how much you could receive, and what you&#8217;ll need in order to file a claim depends on several factors. </p>





<p>Here&#8217;s what to know: </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is eligible to file a claim?</h2>



<p>Anybody who was a U.S. Facebook user at any point between May 24, 2007 and Dec. 22, 2022 is eligible to <a href="https://www.facebookuserprivacysettlement.com/#home" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.facebookuserprivacysettlement.com/#home">file a claim</a>.</p>



<p>Under the latest update, individuals who held Facebook accounts during the class period of the lawsuit that are now deleted are also eligible to file a claim.</p>



<p>An email sent to Facebook account holders said that the change affects individuals who deleted one or more Facebook accounts in the class period of May 24, 2007 and Dec. 22, 2022 before creating a new Facebook account in the same period.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do I file a claim?</h2>



<p>Individuals hoping to receive a payment as part of the class-action settlement can file a claim&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebookuserprivacysettlement.com/#submit-claim" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;at any point through Aug. 25, 2023.</p>



<p>Those who are filing a claim for a deleted account are asked to do the following:</p>



<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Go to the Settlement <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.FacebookUserPrivacySettlement.com" data-type="URL" data-id="www.FacebookUserPrivacySettlement.com" target="_blank">Website</a></li>



<li>Click on “Submit Claim.”</li>



<li>Click the link located at the top of the page to edit your claim (“Filed A Claim? Click Here to Edit Your Claim”).</li>



<li>Provide the Notice ID and Confirmation Code provided at the top of this notice in order to access and edit your claim.</li>



<li>In the “Details” section of the form, proceed to the third question (“Are you filing a claim for a current account, a deleted account or a combination of both?”)</li>



<li>Select from the options: “Current Account(s)”, “Deleted Account(s)” or “Both Current and Deleted Accounts.”</li>



<li>Complete the information requested regarding your account(s), as applicable.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What do I need in order to file a claim?</h2>



<p>In addition to providing some personal information, as well has the preferred method of payment, class-action members will be <a href="https://www.facebookuserprivacysettlement.com/#submit-claim" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.facebookuserprivacysettlement.com/#submit-claim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked to submit their Facebook username</a>, along with any phone numbers and email addresses associated with the account. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">How to find your Facebook username</h2>



<p>Your specific Facebook username can be found by logging onto your Facebook account, and then navigating to: “Account” &gt; “Settings and Privacy” &gt; “General Account Settings” &gt; “Username.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How much money could I receive in a payment?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/how-much-could-you-get-in-new-725m-facebook-settlement-heres-what-we-know-so-far/3122423/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/how-much-could-you-get-in-new-725m-facebook-settlement-heres-what-we-know-so-far/3122423/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The payment size </a>for each individual ultimately depends on how long each person was a Facebook user and how many users ultimately file a claim before the deadline, the settlement administrator says.</p>



<p>Administrative and court costs will initially be deducted from the overall settlement total, creating a &#8220;net settlement fund,&#8221; which payments will be paid out of from.</p>



<p>The amount each claimant receives will then be determined by the length of Facebook usage and number of overall claimants.</p>



<p>Each eligible claimant will be assigned &#8220;one point for each month&#8221; they had an activated Facebook account during that window. Once the total number of claimants and their points have been determined, along with the total settlement fund amount, each person will then receive a designated amount, multiplied by their total number of points. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Deadlines to know</h2>



<p>The deadline for those looking to object to or opt out of the settlement was July 26, 2023. </p>



<p>Those who do not file a claim, opt out or object to the settlement are automatically part of the settlement, but are ineligible to receive a payment unless a claim is filed.</p>



<p>The deadline to file a claim is on Aug. 25, 2023.</p>



<p>The final approval hearing for the settlement is scheduled for Sept. 7, 2023 at 11 a.m. CDT.</p>



<p>More information about the newest settlement can be found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebookuserprivacysettlement.com/#faqs" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.facebookuserprivacysettlement.com/#faqs" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>It was a case of insult to injury for Patricia Gift. The Philadelphia woman told NBC10 she received speeding tickets from the Philadelphia Parking Authority (PPA) totaling $525 after speed cameras captured her car speeding down Roosevelt Boulevard four times on March 12 and March 14. Gift said there was one major issue however. She wasn’t the person behind the wheel. </p>



<p>Gift’s car was stolen in front of her home back on March 12. She reported the theft and even received a police report. On March 28, she appealed the speeding tickets with the PPA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They sent me an email, said they got my documentation, everything,” she said. “It would take five to seven business days for them to give me an answer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gift told NBC10 she still never got an answer after several weeks however.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Two weeks later I called. I still did not have an answer,” Gift said. “Two weeks later, it’s in review. Week later, it’s in review.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gift then contacted the PPA again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I had a couple of emails to the PPA and they said, ‘We received your information. We are all backlogged. We’re busy and we’ll get to you as soon as possible.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gift then reached out to NBC10 Responds for help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I didn’t know where else to go,” Gift said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NBC10 Responds then reached out to the PPA. </p>



<p>“The speed camera violations associated with this vehicle, along with supporting dispute documents, were sent by the PPA to the Office of Administrative Review (OAR), the agency that reviews speed camera disputes,” a spokesperson wrote. “At the request of the PPA, OAR conducted an expedited review of all the violations and dismissed them.”</p>



<p>Gift then called to check on her status and confirmed the violations were dismissed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NBC10 Responds also reached out to Philadelphia’s OAR to find out how long it takes to review speed camera disputes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When the PPA received the information from Ms. Gift on 4/24, it was placed on an Admin Review sheet sent to OAR from PPA every 2-3 weeks. On this sheet are cases that need specific action by OAR,” a city spokesperson wrote.  </p>



<p>“Ms. Gift’s tickets were sent on the May 8th’s Admin Review Sheet, along with 100 other cases that needed review. Generally, OAR reviews these cases within the 2-3 weeks time frame.”</p>



<p>Gift’s email history with the PPA showed that she sent them her appeal on March 28 rather than April 24 however. When NBC10 Responds asked the city to address the discrepancy, they sent us back to the PPA which confirmed it received Gift’s first appeal on March 28. They didn’t have any additional comments however and it remains unclear why it took the PPA nearly a month to send Gift’s case for review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If somebody is in the same situation as me, do not give up,” Gift said. “Be persistent. You will get somewhere.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.phila.gov/departments/office-of-administrative-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you find yourself in a similar situation to Gift, you should contact Philadelphia’s Office of Administrative Review directly.</a></p>

<p>More than half of Americans plan to host guests for Thanksgiving this year. NBC10 Responds is helping you manage your money with tips on cutting down on the cost of dinner.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/study/thanksgiving-cost-report/">A new survey from LendingTree</a> reports Thanksgiving hosting duties this year could cost an average of $431 for food, drinks and décor, a 19% increase compared to last year.</p>



<p><strong><em><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/">Léelo en españo</a><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">l</a><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/accion-de-gracias-2024-guia-y-consejos-de-compra-para-el-festivo/2447136/"> aquí</a></em></strong></p>



<p>“Even though inflation is slowing down, prices aren’t falling,” Matt Schultz, Chief Credit Analyst at LendingTree, told NBC10. “And I think that that’s probably going to have an impact on how people approach Thanksgiving.”</p>



<p>Schultz said the right credit card – used wisely – can make a difference when shopping for Thanksgiving dinner. He advises shoppers to look for signup bonuses or cash back offers.</p>



<p>“If you already have money saved back for the holidays, instead of paying for everything around Thanksgiving or Christmas with cash, get a new credit card,” Schultz said. “Use that card to the amount that it takes to get that $100 or $200 signup bonus and then use the cash you have in savings to pay off that card.”</p>



<p>Around 60% of Thanksgiving hosts expect their guests to offer money or an item to help offset expenses.</p>



<p>“Don&#8217;t be afraid to be a little bit vulnerable and say, you know, I&#8217;m trying to pay down debt so things are a little more difficult,” Schultz said. “Would it be okay if instead of pitching in financially, maybe I show up a little earlier and help decorate or help more with the food? Getting creative with those sorts of things can help you keep your costs down.”</p>



<p>Schultz also recommends shopping around.</p>



<p>“If you’re willing to maybe venture away from the typical grocery store that you go to or your favorite other types of retailers, you may be able to find some deals that help you keep those costs down,” Schultz said.</p>



<p>Schultz also said to stick to a plan and a list wherever you end up shopping.</p>



<p>“Not necessarily knowing what they&#8217;re looking for and just kind of looking for inspiration,” Schultz said. “And they end up giving in to impulse and kind of wrecking their budget that way.”</p>



<p>Remember to also research different deals or perks your grocery store offers during the holidays, including Thanksgiving meal packages for certain group sizes.</p>

<p>If you have leftover Bed Bath &amp; Beyond gift cards in your wallet, or a stash of coupons in your junk drawer, you only have a few more days to use them before they’re useless.</p>



<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/business/money-report/bed-bath-beyond-vows-it-can-pull-off-a-sale-heres-what-that-means-for-shareholders/3334879/" target="_blank">struggling</a> home goods retailer, which also owns Buybuy Baby, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after it <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/business/money-report/bed-bath-beyond-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/3334353/" target="_blank">failed in several last-ditch efforts</a> to raise enough money to keep the company alive.</p>



<p>That means the clock is ticking on finding last-minute deals or using up those gift cards.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Last Day to Use Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Coupons and Welcome Rewards</h2>



<p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond addressed updates on coupon use in the <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/knowledgecenter/article/chapter-11-faq">frequently asked questions</a> section of their website.</p>



<p>&#8220;Customers can no longer redeem coupons,&#8221; the website stated.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s still a way to use them: The Container Store <a href="https://investor.containerstore.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/The-Container-Store-Group-Inc.-Expands-Its-College-Offering/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> it will offer 20% off any single item through May 31, 2023, if you bring &#8220;a competitor&#8217;s blue coupon&#8221; to one of their locations.</p>



<p>Welcome Rewards points can be redeemed until May 15. No new rewards can be redeemed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Deadline to Use Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and BuyBuy Baby Gift Cards</h2>



<p>The company said they expect that gift cards will continue to be accepted through May 8.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">What About Returns and Credits?</h2>



<p>Items bought before April 26 can be returned until May 24.</p>



<p>Merchandise credits can be used through May 8.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">When Will Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Close?</h2>



<p>For the time being, all 360 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores and 120 Buybuy Baby locations will remain open for customers.</p>



<p>The retailer said it will start an orderly wind-down of its operations but will continue to seek a buyer for all or some of its businesses.</p>

<p>Spring break season has arrived and college students will be vacationing in many parts of the United States, Caribbean, Mexico, and other destinations around of the world.</p>



<p>After the most recent kidnapping of Americans in Mexico, visitors – including spring breakers – are being advised to continue practicing extreme caution while in the country.</p>



<p>A group of four childhood friends from North Carolina drove to Mexico last week for a medical procedure and were <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/two-americans-dead-after-being-abducted-in-mexico-and-two-others-alive-official-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacked and kidnapped by cartel gunman</a>, FBI officials said. Two of the Americans were killed and two survived the deadly encounter, in which officials say may have been a case of mistaken identity.</p>



<p>Tamaulipas, where the kidnapping occurred, was listed on the State Department’s “Do Not Travel” list, citing a heightened risk of crime and kidnapping.</p>



<p>“Violent crime – such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery – is widespread and common in Mexico,” the department wrote on it’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/mexico-travel-advisory.html" target="_blank">travel advisory</a>, which was last updated in October.</p>



<p>U.S. travel advisories are issued in four levels: exercise normal precautions, exercise increased caution, reconsider travel, and do not travel.</p>



<p>These states are on the Do Not Travel list:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sinaloa</li>



<li>Zacatecas</li>



<li>Tamaulipas</li>



<li>Colima</li>



<li>Guerrero</li>



<li>Michoacán</li>
</ul>







<p>State officials also warned that the U.S. government is limited to the emergency services it can provide in many parts of the Mexico and issued guidelines for Americans visiting the country.</p>



<ul>
<li>Keep traveling companions and family back home informed of your travel plans. If separating from your travel group, send a friend your GPS location. If taking a taxi alone, take a photo of the taxi number and/or license plate and text it to a friend.</li>



<li>Use toll roads when possible and avoid driving alone or at night. In many states, police presence and emergency services are extremely limited outside the state capital or major cities.</li>



<li>Exercise increased caution when visiting local bars, nightclubs, and casinos.</li>



<li>Do not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive watches or jewelry.</li>



<li>Be extra vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs.</li>
</ul>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Beginning in January 2021 a lot of people got a lesson in the Philadelphia City Wage Tax and how to get a refund. </p>



<p>Many people who live outside of the city, but work in the city were forced to work from home because of the pandemic. Those employees didn’t have to pay the city wage tax for days not worked in the city, and thus were entitled to a refund.</p>



<p>Cut to 2022 when a lot of people went back to work in the city. But, not everyone and not every day.</p>



<p>Rebecca Lopez Kriss, the Deputy Revenue Commissioner for the City of Philadelphia, talked with NBC10 Responds about changes taxpayers can expect this year when it comes to collecting a wage tax refund.</p>



<p>“I think there is confusion about that. Both on the part of employees and employers,” Lopez Kriss said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>Do You Qualify for City Wage Tax Refund?</strong></h2>



<p>Here’s where things get confusing: if you worked a hybrid schedule, sometimes in the city of Philadelphia and sometimes not, you’re not automatically guaranteed eligibility for a city wage tax refund.</p>



<p>The question is: Were you required?</p>



<p>Lopez Kriss explained, “That&#8217;s a little bit different than my employer says I may work outside, I may from home two, three days a week and I may come in two days.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading"><strong>How Do You Get the City Wage Tax Refund?</strong></h2>



<p>If you’re hoping to collect a City Wage Tax refund, you’ll need documentation from your employer. The letter must include: the period of time that you would have worked from home, and that needs to corroborate with what you document on your refund petition.</p>



<p>According to the city, the best and fastest way to get your refund is online through the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tax-services.phila.gov/_/" target="_blank">Philadelphia Tax Center</a>.  You’ll need your W2 and the letter from your employer specifically about you. Refunds can take anywhere from six to 12 weeks.</p>



<p>The Philadelphia Revenue Department is launching a “Where’s My Refund” tool in March that will allow you to check the status of your refund at any time.</p>
