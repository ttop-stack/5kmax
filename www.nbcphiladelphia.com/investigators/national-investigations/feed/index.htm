				<![CDATA[
<p>The Los Angeles Police Department announced Monday the case of Hannah Kobayashi, the woman from Hawaii who vanished last month after landing at LAX, is now a voluntary missing person case, explaining its investigators have video evidence of Kobayashi crossing the border into Mexico on foot.</p>



<p>Law enforcement sources had confirmed to NBC Los Angeles that Kobayashi was believed to be in Mexico, and there was no evidence of foul play in her disappearance. </p>



<p>&#8220;We reviewed video surveillance from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which clearly shows Kobayashi crossing the United States border on foot into Mexico. She was alone with her luggage and appeared unharmed,&#8221; LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said during a news conference Monday.</p>



<p>The LAPD officials also confirmed Kobayashi walked through the tunnel at the San Ysidro Port of Entry alone.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an adult and she can choose to be missing,&#8221; one senior law enforcement official told NBCLA, and added that detectives still hoped Kobayashi would get in touch with authorities so they could confirm she&#8217;s safe and traveling of her own free will.</p>

<p>The LAPD officials explained border security video showed Kobayashi leaving the United States near Tijuana on Tuesday, Nov. 12 at around 12:13 p.m., a day or so after members of her family said they had last heard from her via text message.</p>



<p>There have been no confirmed communications with her since then, and authorities said they suspect Kobayashi may have left her cellphone somewhere in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>Chief McDonnell added Kobayashi is not a suspect in any criminal activity.</p>



<p>&#8220;To date, the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play,&#8221; the LAPD chief said. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Kobayashi back out of her initial plans to visit New York and decide to cut off contact with some friends and family, but McDonnell said the 30-year-old had previously expressed her desire to &#8220;step away from modern connectivity.&#8221;</p>



<p>Law enforcement sources also told NBC Los Angeles&#8217; Investigative Reporter Eric Leonard that this is not the first time Kobayashi has gone missing as there have been other incidents previously. The sources did not elaborate on when or where those occurred. </p>



<p>Last week, LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell repeated publicly the department&#8217;s initial findings in its search for Kobayashi, 30, that it appeared she chose to remain in Los Angeles on Nov. 8 after her flight from Hawaii landed at LAX, and she failed to board the flight for the next leg of her planned trip to New York.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which, the investigation determined was intentional,&#8221; McDonnell told the Board of Police Commissioners.</p>



<p>McDonnell misreported that Kobayashi is 23 years old, rather than 30, and members of Kobayashi&#8217;s family, who had been posting updates on a Facebook page, complainted they were not contacted by the LAPD prior to McDonnell&#8217;s statement.</p>



<p>The Facebook page that was focused on the search efforts was taken down.</p>



<p>On Sunday, Nov. 24, police said they found Kobayashi&#8217;s father, Ryan, dead by suicide near LAX, after he had traveled to Los Angeles from Hawaii to assist in the search efforts.</p>



<p>Ryan Kobayashi was 58 and <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/la-county-medical-examiner-reveals-cause-of-death-for-ryan-kobayashi-father-of-missing-hawaii-woman/3570558/">died as the result of multiple blunt force traumatic injuries</a>, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner.</p>

<p>Hannah Kobayashi&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/missing-woman-lax-hawaii/3563315/">family said it last had contact with her</a> around Sunday, Nov. 10 when she said she had returned to LAX to try to get on another flight to New York, and family members characterized some of the text messages as, &#8216;strange,&#8217; before losing contact.</p>



<p>“Messages saying she did not feel safe, she was worried about people stealing her money, it was after that those strange messages she went dark,” Kobayashi&#8217;s aunt Laire Pidgeon told NBCLA on Nov. 19.</p>



<p>While in LA over the weekend, police traced some of her movements and said she had visited the Grove shopping center.</p>



<p>Kobayashi&#8217;s family members said they had seen security video that appeared to show her at a Metro train station near Crypto.com Arena, and said at the time, &#8220;it is evident that Hannah does not appear to be in good condition and she is not alone.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>It’s been six months since minimum wage for workers at large fast food chains in California went from $16 to $20 an hour.</p>



<p>Restaurant operators opposed the new law, claiming it would force them to raise their prices and cut jobs, but economists at UC Berkeley say their data contradicts those predictions.</p>



<p><a href="https://irle.berkeley.edu/publications/press-release/new-study-analyzes-impact-of-californias-20-minimum-wage-for-fast-food-workers/" data-type="link" data-id="https://irle.berkeley.edu/publications/press-release/new-study-analyzes-impact-of-californias-20-minimum-wage-for-fast-food-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at UC Berkeley</a> compared Glassdoor job posts and online food menu prices two weeks before the minimum wage raise and 2 weeks after. It found that wages increased by 18%, employment numbers remained stable and menu prices increased by only 3 to 7%, or 15 cents on a $4 burger.</p>



<p>Anneisha Williams said she knows the impacts firsthand. She’s been supporting her seven children on this minimum wage.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ve seen new employees getting hired,” she said. &#8220;So I feel absolutely not. They&#8217;re not losing out on business. I feel that they&#8217;re growing more on business because if not, why are you guys still hiring employees?</p>





<p>But what about the restaurant closures? Like 48 Rubio locations that shut down across the state.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very rare to really see a policy like the minimum wage lead to restaurants exiting the market unless they were already marginally on the edge of making it or not making it. And so, it&#8217;s really the other reasons that were causing the precarity of the restaurant,&#8221; said Dr. Enrique Lopezlira, the director of the Low Wage Work Program at UC Berkeley&#8217;s Labor Center. </p>



<p>But a survey given to fast food employers in<a href="https://irle.berkeley.edu/publications/press-release/new-study-analyzes-impact-of-californias-20-minimum-wage-for-fast-food-workers/" data-type="link" data-id="https://irle.berkeley.edu/publications/press-release/new-study-analyzes-impact-of-californias-20-minimum-wage-for-fast-food-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> July by the Employment Policies Institute, </a>had very different results. The majority anticipated decreases in employment and significant increases in menu prices.</p>



<p>Though in the same month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed California had approximately 750,000 fast food jobs, roughly 11,000 more than when the higher minimum wage law took effect.</p>



<p>&#8220;The CEOs just need to be fair with their workers. You know, that&#8217;s what I feel overall, you know,&#8221; Williams said. </p>



<p>The study’s authors said that profit margins at fast food restaurants are relatively high compared to full service restaurants, companies have room to absorb higher wage costs.</p>



<p>The study comes as the California Fast Food Council considers further increasing the minimum wage in 2025 and in November voters will decide on a Prop 32 that would increase the statewide minimum wage for other workers to $18 an hour.</p>

<p>The LAPD said Tuesday that the parents of three teenagers who were allegedly shown in security video from recent flash mob-style robberies at convenience stores had brought their children to police stations so they could be arrested.</p>



<p>The teens were booked on suspicion of robbery at the Northeast, 77th, and Southwest stations, and Assistant Chief Blake Chow said the surrenders were a direct result of the department last week publicizing the <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/lapd-releases-photos-of-flash-mob-responsible-for-string-of-7-eleven-robberies/3521120/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/lapd-releases-photos-of-flash-mob-responsible-for-string-of-7-eleven-robberies/3521120/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">images from a number of the thefts</a>.</p>





<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still taking tips in, and hopefully we&#8217;ll get more information regarding the individuals who are engaging in the flash mob,&#8221; Chow told the Board of Police Commissioners.</p>



<p>The teens were released while the evidence is evaluated by prosecutors, he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting to hear that parents themselves were active in getting their children to be held accountable for those and to face consequences,&#8221; said Commissioner Rasha Gerges Shields, who is vice-president of the panel.</p>



<p>At least <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/lapd-releases-photos-of-flash-mob-responsible-for-string-of-7-eleven-robberies/3521120/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">14 different 7-Eleven stores in LA have targeted since July </a>by organized mobs of thieves, who often arrive on bicycles and overwhelm store employees while stealing food and other items, and destroying shelves, appliances, and fixtures.</p>



<p>The LAPD last week shared photos and video clips from some of the robberies in the hope of identifying the participants.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The Los Angeles Police Department announced Monday the case of Hannah Kobayashi, the woman from Hawaii who vanished last month after landing at LAX, is now a voluntary missing person case, explaining its investigators have video evidence of Kobayashi crossing the border into Mexico on foot.</p>



<p>Law enforcement sources had confirmed to NBC Los Angeles that Kobayashi was believed to be in Mexico, and there was no evidence of foul play in her disappearance. </p>



<p>&#8220;We reviewed video surveillance from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which clearly shows Kobayashi crossing the United States border on foot into Mexico. She was alone with her luggage and appeared unharmed,&#8221; LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said during a news conference Monday.</p>



<p>The LAPD officials also confirmed Kobayashi walked through the tunnel at the San Ysidro Port of Entry alone.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an adult and she can choose to be missing,&#8221; one senior law enforcement official told NBCLA, and added that detectives still hoped Kobayashi would get in touch with authorities so they could confirm she&#8217;s safe and traveling of her own free will.</p>

<p>The LAPD officials explained border security video showed Kobayashi leaving the United States near Tijuana on Tuesday, Nov. 12 at around 12:13 p.m., a day or so after members of her family said they had last heard from her via text message.</p>



<p>There have been no confirmed communications with her since then, and authorities said they suspect Kobayashi may have left her cellphone somewhere in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>Chief McDonnell added Kobayashi is not a suspect in any criminal activity.</p>



<p>&#8220;To date, the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play,&#8221; the LAPD chief said. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Kobayashi back out of her initial plans to visit New York and decide to cut off contact with some friends and family, but McDonnell said the 30-year-old had previously expressed her desire to &#8220;step away from modern connectivity.&#8221;</p>



<p>Law enforcement sources also told NBC Los Angeles&#8217; Investigative Reporter Eric Leonard that this is not the first time Kobayashi has gone missing as there have been other incidents previously. The sources did not elaborate on when or where those occurred. </p>



<p>Last week, LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell repeated publicly the department&#8217;s initial findings in its search for Kobayashi, 30, that it appeared she chose to remain in Los Angeles on Nov. 8 after her flight from Hawaii landed at LAX, and she failed to board the flight for the next leg of her planned trip to New York.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which, the investigation determined was intentional,&#8221; McDonnell told the Board of Police Commissioners.</p>



<p>McDonnell misreported that Kobayashi is 23 years old, rather than 30, and members of Kobayashi&#8217;s family, who had been posting updates on a Facebook page, complainted they were not contacted by the LAPD prior to McDonnell&#8217;s statement.</p>



<p>The Facebook page that was focused on the search efforts was taken down.</p>



<p>On Sunday, Nov. 24, police said they found Kobayashi&#8217;s father, Ryan, dead by suicide near LAX, after he had traveled to Los Angeles from Hawaii to assist in the search efforts.</p>



<p>Ryan Kobayashi was 58 and <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/la-county-medical-examiner-reveals-cause-of-death-for-ryan-kobayashi-father-of-missing-hawaii-woman/3570558/">died as the result of multiple blunt force traumatic injuries</a>, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner.</p>

<p>Hannah Kobayashi&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/missing-woman-lax-hawaii/3563315/">family said it last had contact with her</a> around Sunday, Nov. 10 when she said she had returned to LAX to try to get on another flight to New York, and family members characterized some of the text messages as, &#8216;strange,&#8217; before losing contact.</p>



<p>“Messages saying she did not feel safe, she was worried about people stealing her money, it was after that those strange messages she went dark,” Kobayashi&#8217;s aunt Laire Pidgeon told NBCLA on Nov. 19.</p>



<p>While in LA over the weekend, police traced some of her movements and said she had visited the Grove shopping center.</p>



<p>Kobayashi&#8217;s family members said they had seen security video that appeared to show her at a Metro train station near Crypto.com Arena, and said at the time, &#8220;it is evident that Hannah does not appear to be in good condition and she is not alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philadelphia Customs and Border Protection officers intercepted over 10,000 Xanax pills concealed inside spools of yarn in a shipment headed to New York, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced.</p>



<p>Officials said Customs and Border Protection officers were alerted on April 26 by trade enforcement experts at the Baltimore Field Office, who reviewed incoming cargo manifests and suspected that something may be amiss with this shipment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/confiscan-pastillas-xanax-alprazolam-escondidas-envueltas-hilo-filadelfia-aduanas-proteccion-fronteriza-netherlands/2396619/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.telemundo62.com/noticias/local/confiscan-pastillas-xanax-alprazolam-escondidas-envueltas-hilo-filadelfia-aduanas-proteccion-fronteriza-netherlands/2396619/">Léelo en español aquí</a></p>



<p>Philadelphia Customs and Border Protection officers found that shipment on the same day while inspecting express consignment parcels that arrived from overseas, according to officials. </p>



<p>Officials said officers then x-rayed the shipment &#8211; that was originally coming from the Netherlands &#8211; and detected something abnormal. When opening up the shipment officers found a dozen spools of yarn that were unusually heavy. </p>



<p>Once officers unraveled the yarn revealing stacks of 10-pill blister packs taped to the inner spool, according to officials. </p>



<p>In total, officers seized 1,006 blister packs of 1 mg dose of Alprazolam &#8211; in total 10,060 pills &#8211; worth a street value of about $30,000, officials said. </p>

<p>&#8220;The threads of this seizure were knitted together by people in different locations, but it was the Customs and Border Protection officers in Philadelphia who had a skein-dalous ball unspooling and counting out a huge Xanax load they seized on Friday,&#8221; U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a news release. </p>



<p>Alprazolam, known by the popular brand name Xanax, is a scheduled IV controlled substance. The drug officials said is misused as a recreational drug, and when combined with other substances, such as alcohol, can slow breathing and possibly lead to death.</p>

<p>Jeff Drobman knew something was wrong when <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bank of America</a> alerts popped up on his phone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I started to get notifications that someone tried to log into my account, that my password had been changed,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Chatsworth man tried to call the bank, but he had no signal. </p>



<p>“Why’s my phone not working? What happened? I don’t know,” he said.</p>



<p>When Drobman got to a phone to call Bank of America, a chunk of money was gone from his account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They go, ‘They’ve already withdrawn $21,000 from your account.’ Are you kidding me? That’s half of my bank account,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s what likely happened: It’s called SIM swapping. A crook got a hold of Drobman’s personal information, like his name, address and cell number, and convinced Drobman’s cellphone company, Spectrum, to transfer his cellphone number to a new phone. The crook then had access to Drobman’s text messages and used text message two-factor authentication to get into Drobman’s bank account and steal his money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So the text message went not to my phone, but their phone. So by hijacking my phone, they intercept my text back codes,” he said.</p>



<p>According to the FBI’s most recent data, victims lost more than $68 million to this scam in 2021, five times more than in years past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cybersecurity expert Stan Stahl is trying to bring those numbers down. He founded <a href="https://securethevillage.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secure the Village</a>, a nonprofit dedicated to educating people about cybersecurity.</p>



<p>He says what happened to Drobman can happen to you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Jeff was not specifically targeted because he was Jeff. He may have been specifically targeted because they ran across his information. But that could happen to any of us,” said Stahl.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stahl largely blames Spectrum for its lack of security. He says they made it too easy for crooks to steal Drobman’s cellphone number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So Spectrum wants to make it as easy as possible for people to go buy a new phone. But in thinking about that, Spectrum, and every company like them, has to think about the risk side of the equation,” he said.</p>



<p>Stahl said all wireless companies should require customers to have a personal identification number (PIN) that they must use to make any account changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A trade group for wireless providers agrees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spectrum told the I-Team it recently started requiring PINs for number transfers, but it wouldn’t comment on how crooks bypassed this to steal Drobman’s number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our mobile carriers have to be called on the carpet for that, they’ve got to fix that. They can’t just transfer phone numbers because somebody asked you to,” said Drobman.</p>



<p>On the banking side of this scam, Stahl said text codes for two-factor authentication aren’t safe either. He said banks should instead use face recognition or an authentication app.</p>



<p>But the banking industry defends text back codes. Bank of America pointed us to a banking trade group for comment. The <a href="https://www.aba.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Bankers Association</a> said the industry invests billions of dollars in cybersecurity, and text back codes provide a significant defense against account takeover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drobman doesn’t buy it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I want to get the word out that text back codes are not safe,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the I-Team reached out to Bank of America about Drobman’s case, it put $21,000 &#8212; the amount stolen from him &#8212; back into his account. In a statement, it said it takes identity theft seriously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drobman believes he’s now as secure as he can be. But he’s disappointed that these two companies both failed to keep his money and identity safe.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Tips to keep your money safe:</h2>



<ul>
<li>Create a PIN with your wireless carrier.</li>



<li>If your bank allows it, use facial recognition, instead of two-factor authentication, to make account changes.</li>



<li>If you unexpectedly lose your cellphone signal, contact your carrier right away to make sure your number hasn’t been hacked.</li>
</ul>

				<![CDATA[
<p>When Henry Garland got into a car crash along Interstate 270 near Rockville, Maryland, he said there was no doubt in his mind who hit him.</p>



<p>“Big blue arrow on the side of the blue truck,” said Garland, referring to an <a href="http://amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a> delivery truck that he says sideswiped him.</p>



<p>Garland said the incident caused roughly $2,000 in damages to his truck and trailer. And he thought after exchanging information with the driver, repairs would be easy.</p>



<p>“You just wouldn’t believe how many different scenarios that played out in this and how many different people that I’ve talked to over this,” said Garland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s because Garland found out that the truck emblazoned with the Amazon logo — and the driver who he said hit him — really wasn’t Amazon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">&#8216;Not Amazon employees&#8217;</h2>



<p>“These people are not Amazon employees. The person that comes to your door with your package says ‘Amazon’ and on the uniform. The truck says ‘Prime’ and ‘Amazon.’ They’re not,” said Patrick Regan, a personal injury lawyer in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>He said he’s handled dozens of these kinds of cases involving Amazon delivery trucks. Including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/woman-hit-by-amazon-truck-in-northwest-dc/3504305/" target="_blank">this</a> crash on Dec. 30 when, Regan said, a delivery truck hit a D.C. woman while she was in the crosswalk at the intersection of Cathedral and Massachusetts avenues.</p>



<p>“Her son called me and said, ‘My mother was hit by an Amazon van,’” Regan said. “Your viewers are going to look at this, saying, ‘Yeah, that’s an Amazon van.’”</p>





<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">
<p>According to the D.C. police crash report obtained by the <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC Washington I-Team</a>, several witnesses observed the collision. One witness stated the victim was in the crosswalk and “crossing the street.” In the report, the driver stated he started to make a left turn onto Massachusetts Avenue when he “felt a bump coming from the rear tire.” The driver said he “stopped and exited the vehicle” and observed the victim “laying on the ground and under the rear driver’s side tire.” The driver then stated he got back into the vehicle and backed up so the vehicle was no longer on top of her. Police on the scene reported the victim could not be interviewed due to her injuries. Regan said his client suffered multiple broken bones and just got out of the hospital last month.</p>
</div>



<p>“She faces a very, a very difficult, a very long recovery,” said Regan.</p>



<p>Despite the Prime logo on the truck, Regan said the vehicle was actually a third-party company, what Amazon calls a delivery service partner (DSP). An Amazon spokesperson told the I-Team the company uses more than 3,500 DSPs to deliver 20 million packages a day across 19 countries.</p>



<p>“They say Amazon on their uniform, they say Prime and Amazon on the truck, but they disavow any legal responsibility,” said Regan.&nbsp;</p>





<div class="wp-block-nbc-localized-block">
<p>That&#8217;s what Patty Means found out when a delivery driver rolled his Amazon van last summer crashing into her front yard in Arlington County, Virginia. She learned he worked for a third-party company.</p>
</div>



<p>In the police report, the driver admitted “he was tired.” When asked who was responsible for the $5,000 in damage to Means’ landscaping, she replied, “Amazon is responsible to pay for this damage.”</p>



<p>But Means said calling Amazon got her nowhere. She was directed to contact a company she’d never heard of. Turns out it was a DSP. But their insurance company never responded to her, Means said. So, she filed with her insurance company, which took over the fight.</p>



<p>“I would drop dead if I heard back from Amazon two months after the fact,” said Means.</p>



<p>Eight months later, she did hear back, but not from Amazon. Her insurance company told her the DSP, which owned the vehicle, ended up paying her claim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The News4 I-Team reached out to Amazon about its DSP program. Spokesperson Branden Baribeau said: <strong>“</strong>Since 2018, the Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program has empowered entrepreneurs who want to launch and operate their own delivery service to do business with Amazon. Now, more than 3,500 DSPs are delivering over 20 million packages every day across 19 countries. As has always been the case, nothing is more important to us than safety, which is why over the last five years we’ve invested more than $8 billion in state-of-the-art technology, safety enhancements, vehicle fleets, and exclusive services for DSPs and their drivers. These investments in safety technology and programs in delivery vehicles have decreased collision rates by 40%. And we’re not done; we’re always innovating with new technology, making process improvements, and helping DSPs provide better training to their employees to improve the safety of drivers, customers and the communities we serve.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Third-party delivery service partners can cause confusion</h2>



<p>When it comes to those vans and trucks, according to Amazon, DSPs can use their own vehicles or lease Amazon branded vehicles through a third party.</p>



<p>But&nbsp;Regan argues the blurred lines can be confusing to customers.</p>



<p>“Amazon controls every aspect of it, including their uniform, including equipment that’s in the vehicle, including the software that tells them where to take the packages,” Regan said.</p>



<p>Amazon disputes this, saying that they make their relationship with DSPs very clear.</p>



<p>Garland said the DSP driver that hit him initially gave him an expired insurance card. He was finally able to file a claim with a different insurance company, but three months later they denied it.</p>



<p>Neither DSP in Garland’s or Means’ case responded to News4’s emails or calls. Amazon said DSPs are required to carry general liability, insurance policies and workers’ compensation. Lapses in insurance can result in a breach of contract, Amazon said.</p>



<p>Amazon said it also offers training to drivers on how to handle accidents and shared a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-dsp-program-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent release about the program</a>.</p>



<p>Regan said he’s planning to file a lawsuit against Amazon and the DSP to help pay for his client’s recovery.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/entertainment-news/" target="_blank">Actor Hunter Schafer</a> was among dozens of war protesters arrested at NBC&#8217;s headquarters in Manhattan during President Joe Biden’s appearance on “Late Night with Seth Meyers” earlier this week, organizers confirmed Wednesday.</p>



<p>The 25-year-old “Euphoria” star was part of a group of more than 100 demonstrators who packed the lobby at 30 Rockefeller Plaza on Monday afternoon to call for a ceasefire in the <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/Israel-Hamas-War/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel-Hamas war</a>, the group Jewish Voice Peace said.</p>



<p>Schafer and other protesters wore black shirts reading, “Ceasefire Now” and “Not in Our Name&#8221; while chanting “Let Gaza Live” and other slogans as Biden&#8217;s motorcade pulled into the area, according to videos and photos of the event provided by Jewish Voice Peace.</p>

<p>Schafer, who like many protesters also wore a facemask, is seen at one point seated on the floor as others hold up a banner behind her reading, “Jews to Biden: Stop Arming Genocide.”</p>



<p>Representatives for Schafer didn’t respond to messages seeking comment Wednesday, but protest organizers said she and others are due in court sometime next month.</p>



<p>“We commend her commitment to Palestinian freedom and to a future of justice for everyone,” Sonya Meyerson-Knox, of Jewish Voice for Peace, said in an emailed statement confirming the arrest Wednesday.</p>



<p>The NYPD on Wednesday said 30 people were taken into custody and issued summonses for trespassing following the hour-and-a-half-long demonstration.</p>



<p>Biden, meanwhile, said Monday he was optimistic a ceasefire would be reached in the coming days.</p>



<p>“I hope by the end of the weekend,” he told reporters after taping the late show interview. “My national security adviser tells me that we’re close. My hope is by next Monday we’ll have a ceasefire.”</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>ESPN has apologized to the organization that administers the Sports Emmy Awards for submitting fake names in categories where they were not eligible to win.</p>



<p>“Some members of our team were clearly wrong in submitting certain names that may go back to 1997 in Emmy categories where they were not eligible for recognition or statuettes,&#8221; the network said in a statement Thursday.</p>



<p>The Emmy scam was first revealed by The Athletic, which reported that ESPN personalities like Kirk Herbstreit, Lee Corso and Desmond Howard on “College GameDay” were given awards they were not entitled to. There was no evidence, the report said, that any on-air winners knew what happened.</p>



<p>The National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, which administers the Sports Emmy Awards, discovered the fraud through an investigation, which led to ESPN doing its own probe.</p>



<p>“This was a misguided attempt to recognize on-air individuals who were important members of our production team,&#8221; ESPN said in its statement.</p>



<p>The Athletic report said on-air talent were not allowed to be included with those credited for the Emmy category of outstanding weekly studio show. Hosts, analysts and reporters on the show could win individual awards, but were prohibited from what the academy calls “double dipping.”</p>



<p>So fake names were submitted with the same initials as on-air hosts and reporters like Kirk Henry (Kirk Herbstreit), Lee Clark (Lee Corso) and Dirk Howard (Desmond Howard) appeared on credit lists as associate producers.</p>



<p>The Athletic reviewed credit lists for the years “College GameDay” won for best weekly show (2010-11, 2014-18) and several phony names were on there.</p>



<p>The Athletic said it was not known who led the fraud, but Craig Lazarus, vice president and executive producer of original content and features; Lee Fitting, a senior vice president of production who oversaw “College GameDay” and other properties; and Drew Gallagher, a coordinating producer on “College GameDay,” were among the ESPN employees NATAS ruled ineligible from future participation in the Emmys.</p>



<p>A statement from the academy said it found several fake credits submitted by ESPN to multiple Sports Emmy competitions. Once ESPN senior management was alerted, “the network took steps to take responsibility for the actions of its personnel, to investigate thoroughly, and to course correct.”</p>



<p>Those steps included returning statuettes issued to fictitious individuals, the academy said.</p>



<p>ESPN brought in outside counsel for a full investigation after it was made aware of the scam.</p>



<p>“Individuals found to be responsible were disciplined by ESPN,” the network statement said.</p>

<p>New video shows a Porsche driver slamming into a Florida Highway Patrol trooper during an <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/porsche-driver-arrested-after-hit-and-run-crash-involving-trooper-leads-to-manhunt-in-weston/3195196/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/porsche-driver-arrested-after-hit-and-run-crash-involving-trooper-leads-to-manhunt-in-weston/3195196/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early morning hit-and-run crash in South Florida last week</a>.</p>



<p>The crash happened on Jan. 2 in the westbound lanes of Interstate 75 near Indian Trace in Weston.</p>



<p>FHP officials said 49-year-old Ricardo Jimenez was behind the wheel of the Porsche when he crashed into the trooper&#8217;s vehicle.</p>



<p>The footage released Thursday by FHP shows multiple angles of the Porsche colliding with the trooper&#8217;s cruiser.</p>



<p>The trooper appears to be eating and possibly speaking with someone named Tony on the phone when the Porsche comes up from behind and slams into his cruiser, causing it to spin around.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>While gift-giving is a big part of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/tag/christmas" target="_blank">Christmas holiday</a>, so too is gift returning, but before you head to the store to bring back your unwanted gifts, there are some things experts say you should know. </p>



<p>Store policies and exchanges aren&#8217;t what they used to be, according to the <a href="https://www.bbb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Better Business Bureau</a>, which notes that the previous idea of &#8220;the customer is always right&#8221; may no longer be the case. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://nrf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Retail Federation</a>, almost 20% of gifts will be returned or exchanged after the holidays. </p>



<p>So how can you avoid some of the common pitfalls? </p>



<p>Here are some tips suggested by the BBB: </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Know the policies</h2>



<p>The BBB suggests customers check return policies for various stores and recognize that holiday return policies may differ from a store&#8217;s regular policy. There are things like restocking fees that could apply. Some may offer exchanges only or store credit only. </p>



<p>“The fact is – now it’s a matter of goodwill and customer service. However, stores are not legally required to accept exchanges or give refunds unless the merchandise was defective or misrepresented,&#8221; Steve&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Bernas, president and CEO of the Better Business Bureau, said in a statement. &#8220;While most retailers offer refund and exchange programs, how and when they do is strictly up to them. Be sure to double-check policies this holiday season, even if you are familiar with the brand, as stores can change their policies whenever they want.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Check online policies</h2>



<p>&#8220;If you are shopping online, search for the seller’s return policy and read it through before clicking &#8216;buy,'&#8221; the group says. &#8220;Find out if they accept returns or exchanges and who pays for the shipping when an item is returned. In some cases, you can save on shipping fees by returning an online purchase to the local brick-and-mortar store.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Find the warranty </h2>



<p>For those who may have received electronics or appliances, many come with a warranty, but those likely won&#8217;t come from the retailer where the item was purchased. Instead, they come from the manufacturer. </p>



<p>&#8220;Find out how returns and repairs are handled if an item stops working or needs replacement parts. Will the retailer ship the item to the manufacturer for you? Or will you need to deal with the manufacturer directly? Knowing the answers will leave you well-prepared for any future issues,&#8221; the BBB said. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Keep receipts</h2>



<p>Some stores will only accept returns and exchanges with an item&#8217;s receipt and original packaging, according to the BBB. </p>



<p>&#8220;Always include a gift receipt with items you give and hold on to any gift receipts you receive,&#8221; the group said. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Bring your ID</h2>



<p>In some cases, stores will ask to see a customer&#8217;s ID as they return an item, or the original form of payment. </p>



<p>&#8220;If this is the policy of the store where your gift is from, you may need the assistance of the gift giver in order to be reimbursed,&#8221; the BBB said. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-nbc-section-heading">Do it sooner than later</h2>



<p>The BBB advises shoppers to &#8220;make returns in a timely fashion.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Almost all return policies are valid during a specific time period,&#8221; the group said. &#8220;Some stores modify their return period during the holidays, so don’t risk missing your chance to make your return. Take the item back to the store without delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man charged Monday with the serial murders of three homeless men around Los Angeles, and the follow-home robbery and murder of an LA County employee in San Dimas, was the recipient of a $700,000 personal injury payment in recent months, court records and city officials confirmed.</p>



<p>Jerrid Powell, 33, received final approval for the payment in June by the Santa Monica City Council, after he sued following a 2019 accident, in which he said he was severely injured after being run-over by a city beach patrol vehicle.</p>



<p>A city spokesperson confirmed the case had been resolved and told the NBC4 I-Team in a statement, &#8220;the city settled the lawsuit claiming negligence after a Santa Monica Harbor Services Officer, after responding to a call reporting a fire on the beach, rolled over the plaintiff who was laying in a six to eight-inch-deep ditch in the sand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Powell was arrested last week, first in connection with the San Dimas murder, then on suspicion of the three other murders, after police said ballistic comparisons matched a gun found in Powell&#8217;s car with all of the killings.</p>



<p>Powell made a brief appearance in LA Superior Court late Monday but postponed entering pleas to the four murder charges. The LA County District Attorney&#8217;s Office said Powell also faced charges of residential robbery and being a felon in possession of a gun.</p>



<p>The felony conviction was the result of a no-contest plea Powell entered in an assault with a deadly weapon case in San Bernardino County in 2018, court records showed.</p>

<p>Powell was sentenced to three years of probation in the case, and in the weeks and months after the plea, was arrested and charged for two theft cases, according to court and jail records.</p>



<p>After the 2019 Santa Monica incident Powell filed a handwritten lawsuit over what appeared to be a dispute over rent, alleging he had been the victim of intentional emotional damage and sexual harassment. </p>



<p>Powell demanded $3.3 million in damages. A judge later dismissed the case.</p>



<p>Civil court records also showed Powell resolved a lawsuit filed against him by a surgery center in Los Angeles. </p>



<p>The case was dismissed on Nov. 30, the same day he was arrested in the San Dimas murder, with an indication Powell had paid the center&#8217;s outstanding bill.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Police Department announced Monday the case of Hannah Kobayashi, the woman from Hawaii who vanished last month after landing at LAX, is now a voluntary missing person case, explaining its investigators have video evidence of Kobayashi crossing the border into Mexico on foot.</p>



<p>Law enforcement sources had confirmed to NBC Los Angeles that Kobayashi was believed to be in Mexico, and there was no evidence of foul play in her disappearance. </p>



<p>&#8220;We reviewed video surveillance from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which clearly shows Kobayashi crossing the United States border on foot into Mexico. She was alone with her luggage and appeared unharmed,&#8221; LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said during a news conference Monday.</p>



<p>The LAPD officials also confirmed Kobayashi walked through the tunnel at the San Ysidro Port of Entry alone.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an adult and she can choose to be missing,&#8221; one senior law enforcement official told NBCLA, and added that detectives still hoped Kobayashi would get in touch with authorities so they could confirm she&#8217;s safe and traveling of her own free will.</p>

<p>The LAPD officials explained border security video showed Kobayashi leaving the United States near Tijuana on Tuesday, Nov. 12 at around 12:13 p.m., a day or so after members of her family said they had last heard from her via text message.</p>



<p>There have been no confirmed communications with her since then, and authorities said they suspect Kobayashi may have left her cellphone somewhere in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>Chief McDonnell added Kobayashi is not a suspect in any criminal activity.</p>



<p>&#8220;To date, the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play,&#8221; the LAPD chief said. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Kobayashi back out of her initial plans to visit New York and decide to cut off contact with some friends and family, but McDonnell said the 30-year-old had previously expressed her desire to &#8220;step away from modern connectivity.&#8221;</p>



<p>Law enforcement sources also told NBC Los Angeles&#8217; Investigative Reporter Eric Leonard that this is not the first time Kobayashi has gone missing as there have been other incidents previously. The sources did not elaborate on when or where those occurred. </p>



<p>Last week, LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell repeated publicly the department&#8217;s initial findings in its search for Kobayashi, 30, that it appeared she chose to remain in Los Angeles on Nov. 8 after her flight from Hawaii landed at LAX, and she failed to board the flight for the next leg of her planned trip to New York.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which, the investigation determined was intentional,&#8221; McDonnell told the Board of Police Commissioners.</p>



<p>McDonnell misreported that Kobayashi is 23 years old, rather than 30, and members of Kobayashi&#8217;s family, who had been posting updates on a Facebook page, complainted they were not contacted by the LAPD prior to McDonnell&#8217;s statement.</p>



<p>The Facebook page that was focused on the search efforts was taken down.</p>



<p>On Sunday, Nov. 24, police said they found Kobayashi&#8217;s father, Ryan, dead by suicide near LAX, after he had traveled to Los Angeles from Hawaii to assist in the search efforts.</p>



<p>Ryan Kobayashi was 58 and <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/la-county-medical-examiner-reveals-cause-of-death-for-ryan-kobayashi-father-of-missing-hawaii-woman/3570558/">died as the result of multiple blunt force traumatic injuries</a>, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner.</p>

<p>Hannah Kobayashi&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/missing-woman-lax-hawaii/3563315/">family said it last had contact with her</a> around Sunday, Nov. 10 when she said she had returned to LAX to try to get on another flight to New York, and family members characterized some of the text messages as, &#8216;strange,&#8217; before losing contact.</p>



<p>“Messages saying she did not feel safe, she was worried about people stealing her money, it was after that those strange messages she went dark,” Kobayashi&#8217;s aunt Laire Pidgeon told NBCLA on Nov. 19.</p>



<p>While in LA over the weekend, police traced some of her movements and said she had visited the Grove shopping center.</p>



<p>Kobayashi&#8217;s family members said they had seen security video that appeared to show her at a Metro train station near Crypto.com Arena, and said at the time, &#8220;it is evident that Hannah does not appear to be in good condition and she is not alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>New technology coming to stores could stop theft and ease customer access.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/consumer/artificial-intelligence-to-catch-thieves/3327622/">we showed you how</a> a pioneering North Bay grocery store is using artificial intelligence to catch shoplifters. But that’s not the only local tech aimed at stopping non-stop stealing. A Bay Area innovation is poised to change the look of stores everywhere.</p>



<p>Since retail thefts are still happening, many stores now lock up merchandise.</p>



<p>“To see padlocks and chains and rudimentary security measures, that really has to be an indicator that something is wrong here,” said David Johnston of the National Retail Federation.</p>



<p>Veteran loss prevention expert David Johnston studies theft trends for the National Retail Federation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Retailers don’t want to lock up their merchandise. They know it’s an inconvenience for the shoppers,” Johnston added.</p>

<p>These security barriers in stores make it tougher to steal and shop.</p>



<p>“What’s happening today isn’t solving the problem,” said David Ashforth.</p>



<p>Like a lot of us, Ashforth wanted to buy an item at a drugstore that was locked up.</p>



<p>“I had to find someone with a key. It was that moment when the lightbulb went off,” Ashforth recalled.</p>



<p>Ashforth is no ordinary shopper. In Sebastopol, he heads a company called <a href="https://www.digitalmediavending.com">Digital Media Vending International</a>. Its machines are everywhere — in places like hotels and airports — stocked with electronics or toiletries that maybe you forgot to pack. So, when this vending machine guru went to the store and encountered merchandise that a worker had to unlock, he saw an opportunity to redesign stores.</p>



<p>“I thought, ‘Huh. My machine could fit right here and then I wouldn’t have to find a manager with a key anymore,” Ashforth said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His company is investing new shelving for stores. Basically:&nbsp;huge, modular vending machines that can replace entire aisles.</p>



<p>Ashforth’s team calls this an “automated retailer.” Merchandise is stocked safely behind glass — to stop thieves. At the same time, honest shoppers get self-service access that’s faster than waiting for a manager.</p>



<p>“The machine will deliver their products to them in real-time, instantly,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ashforth showed us how it works: you pay in advance online or at an in-store kiosk.</p>



<p>“It prints you a receipt or a pickup code,” Ashforth explained.</p>



<p>Punch in the pick-up code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, a robot activates.</p>



<p>There is a train track running inside the machine, within 15 seconds or so the robot fetches your item and delivers your merchandise.</p>



<p>&nbsp;No waiting, no stealing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yes, because today’s most brazen thieves smash and grab, Ashforth told us some clients are curious about customizing machines with essentially bulletproof glass.</p>



<p>We asked Ashforth what message he’s sending to would-be thieves.</p>



<p>“It’s over,” he said.</p>



<p>These modular machines can cost tens of thousands of dollars each.&nbsp; But stores are losing even bigger money to theft. <a href="https://nrf.com/research/national-retail-security-survey-2023">The National Retail Federation’s newest data</a> shows stores’ losses jumped from $94 billion in 2021 to $112 billion in 2022. The federation surveyed 177 brands. More than half say they’re now boosting security budgets.</p>



<p>“Retailers are asking for help,” said&nbsp; Johnston with the National Retail Federation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’re looking for new and innovative ideas. They’re looking at technology to prevent theft,” he continued.</p>



<p>DMVI can’t share names. But it did tell us there are stores &#8212; whose names you and I would recognize — that are interested in buying these machines to shut down shoplifting.</p>



<p>“There’s about 44 that we’re speaking to right now,” said Ashforth with DMVI.</p>



<p>Other companies make vending machines, too, but David says his team’s the only one targeting theft on a large scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, will the store of tomorrow put everything behind glass? And will stores have to limit your choices?</p>



<p>Ashforth doesn’t think so. He estimates just ten percent of items make up 80 percent of what crooks steal. That ten percent will be stocked on robotic shelves, the rest stays on traditional aisles.</p>



<p>“In a big retail store, you maybe have 50 aisles. Maybe between one and five of those will be automated,” Ashforth said.</p>



<p>Inside his warehouse, Ashforth showed us a prototype — wrapped up and ready to ship. It’ll land at a large chain store — with hundreds of locations — for beta testing.</p>



<p>“This particular retailer wants to move very quickly and make a decision to solve that problem,” Ashforth said.</p>



<p>How quickly will stores change? Ashforth expects it will be just a few months until you see self-service shelves stopping thieves and serving shoppers like you.</p>



<p>“This technology is coming to stores near you,” he said.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The Los Angeles Police Department announced Monday the case of Hannah Kobayashi, the woman from Hawaii who vanished last month after landing at LAX, is now a voluntary missing person case, explaining its investigators have video evidence of Kobayashi crossing the border into Mexico on foot.</p>



<p>Law enforcement sources had confirmed to NBC Los Angeles that Kobayashi was believed to be in Mexico, and there was no evidence of foul play in her disappearance. </p>



<p>&#8220;We reviewed video surveillance from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which clearly shows Kobayashi crossing the United States border on foot into Mexico. She was alone with her luggage and appeared unharmed,&#8221; LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said during a news conference Monday.</p>



<p>The LAPD officials also confirmed Kobayashi walked through the tunnel at the San Ysidro Port of Entry alone.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an adult and she can choose to be missing,&#8221; one senior law enforcement official told NBCLA, and added that detectives still hoped Kobayashi would get in touch with authorities so they could confirm she&#8217;s safe and traveling of her own free will.</p>

<p>The LAPD officials explained border security video showed Kobayashi leaving the United States near Tijuana on Tuesday, Nov. 12 at around 12:13 p.m., a day or so after members of her family said they had last heard from her via text message.</p>



<p>There have been no confirmed communications with her since then, and authorities said they suspect Kobayashi may have left her cellphone somewhere in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>Chief McDonnell added Kobayashi is not a suspect in any criminal activity.</p>



<p>&#8220;To date, the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play,&#8221; the LAPD chief said. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Kobayashi back out of her initial plans to visit New York and decide to cut off contact with some friends and family, but McDonnell said the 30-year-old had previously expressed her desire to &#8220;step away from modern connectivity.&#8221;</p>



<p>Law enforcement sources also told NBC Los Angeles&#8217; Investigative Reporter Eric Leonard that this is not the first time Kobayashi has gone missing as there have been other incidents previously. The sources did not elaborate on when or where those occurred. </p>



<p>Last week, LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell repeated publicly the department&#8217;s initial findings in its search for Kobayashi, 30, that it appeared she chose to remain in Los Angeles on Nov. 8 after her flight from Hawaii landed at LAX, and she failed to board the flight for the next leg of her planned trip to New York.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which, the investigation determined was intentional,&#8221; McDonnell told the Board of Police Commissioners.</p>



<p>McDonnell misreported that Kobayashi is 23 years old, rather than 30, and members of Kobayashi&#8217;s family, who had been posting updates on a Facebook page, complainted they were not contacted by the LAPD prior to McDonnell&#8217;s statement.</p>



<p>The Facebook page that was focused on the search efforts was taken down.</p>



<p>On Sunday, Nov. 24, police said they found Kobayashi&#8217;s father, Ryan, dead by suicide near LAX, after he had traveled to Los Angeles from Hawaii to assist in the search efforts.</p>



<p>Ryan Kobayashi was 58 and <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/la-county-medical-examiner-reveals-cause-of-death-for-ryan-kobayashi-father-of-missing-hawaii-woman/3570558/">died as the result of multiple blunt force traumatic injuries</a>, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner.</p>

<p>Hannah Kobayashi&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/missing-woman-lax-hawaii/3563315/">family said it last had contact with her</a> around Sunday, Nov. 10 when she said she had returned to LAX to try to get on another flight to New York, and family members characterized some of the text messages as, &#8216;strange,&#8217; before losing contact.</p>



<p>“Messages saying she did not feel safe, she was worried about people stealing her money, it was after that those strange messages she went dark,” Kobayashi&#8217;s aunt Laire Pidgeon told NBCLA on Nov. 19.</p>



<p>While in LA over the weekend, police traced some of her movements and said she had visited the Grove shopping center.</p>



<p>Kobayashi&#8217;s family members said they had seen security video that appeared to show her at a Metro train station near Crypto.com Arena, and said at the time, &#8220;it is evident that Hannah does not appear to be in good condition and she is not alone.&#8221;</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>Parents whose children died after taking drugs containing fentanyl were inside a Los Angeles courtroom Wednesday, hoping a judge will allow their lawsuit against the social media company Snapchat to move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was an emotional day for the dozens of parents, who say their children died too soon after taking drugs they did not know contained the powerful synthetic opioid. They are among a group suing Snapchat, alleging in court documents that the social media platform allows people to sell illicit drugs on their platform, leading to deaths.</p>



<p>Jaimie Puerta said he lost his son, Daniel, after he took half a pill that he bought online thinking it was oxycodone. Instead, Los Angeles County sheriff’s investigators determined it was a counterfeit pill loaded with fentanyl, a synthetic drug 50 times more deadly than morphine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>“You have a social media app like Snapchat which is propagating these drug deaths by facilitating and allowing drug dealers to sell illicit counterfeit drugs to our children,” Puerta said.</p>



<p>The lawsuit also alleges Snapchat’s platform makes it difficult for law enforcement to track down evidence of illegal activity.</p>



<p>In Los Angeles Superior Court, attorneys for both sides discussed whether Snapchat can be held liable for what others do on its platform, one of the key issues the judge will take into account before deciding on how&nbsp;to proceed with the case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Snap, Inc., told the I-Team that it cooperates with law enforcement investigations including preserving and disclosing data in response to valid legal requests. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement, a Snap spokesperson added: “It is devastating that the national fentanyl epidemic has taken the lives of so many people and we have great empathy for families who have suffered unimaginable losses. At Snap, we are working hard to stop dealers from abusing our platform. We do this by deploying advanced technologies to proactively find and remove dealers, working closely with law enforcement, collaborating with other technology companies, and by having a zero-tolerance policy where we shut off the infringer&#8217;s account.”</p>



<p>Puerta contends the company should be doing more.</p>



<p>“Right now we are not protecting our children,” he said.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The Los Angeles Police Department announced Monday the case of Hannah Kobayashi, the woman from Hawaii who vanished last month after landing at LAX, is now a voluntary missing person case, explaining its investigators have video evidence of Kobayashi crossing the border into Mexico on foot.</p>



<p>Law enforcement sources had confirmed to NBC Los Angeles that Kobayashi was believed to be in Mexico, and there was no evidence of foul play in her disappearance. </p>



<p>&#8220;We reviewed video surveillance from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which clearly shows Kobayashi crossing the United States border on foot into Mexico. She was alone with her luggage and appeared unharmed,&#8221; LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said during a news conference Monday.</p>



<p>The LAPD officials also confirmed Kobayashi walked through the tunnel at the San Ysidro Port of Entry alone.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an adult and she can choose to be missing,&#8221; one senior law enforcement official told NBCLA, and added that detectives still hoped Kobayashi would get in touch with authorities so they could confirm she&#8217;s safe and traveling of her own free will.</p>

<p>The LAPD officials explained border security video showed Kobayashi leaving the United States near Tijuana on Tuesday, Nov. 12 at around 12:13 p.m., a day or so after members of her family said they had last heard from her via text message.</p>



<p>There have been no confirmed communications with her since then, and authorities said they suspect Kobayashi may have left her cellphone somewhere in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>Chief McDonnell added Kobayashi is not a suspect in any criminal activity.</p>



<p>&#8220;To date, the investigation has not uncovered any evidence that Kobayashi is being trafficked or is the victim of foul play,&#8221; the LAPD chief said. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Kobayashi back out of her initial plans to visit New York and decide to cut off contact with some friends and family, but McDonnell said the 30-year-old had previously expressed her desire to &#8220;step away from modern connectivity.&#8221;</p>



<p>Law enforcement sources also told NBC Los Angeles&#8217; Investigative Reporter Eric Leonard that this is not the first time Kobayashi has gone missing as there have been other incidents previously. The sources did not elaborate on when or where those occurred. </p>



<p>Last week, LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell repeated publicly the department&#8217;s initial findings in its search for Kobayashi, 30, that it appeared she chose to remain in Los Angeles on Nov. 8 after her flight from Hawaii landed at LAX, and she failed to board the flight for the next leg of her planned trip to New York.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which, the investigation determined was intentional,&#8221; McDonnell told the Board of Police Commissioners.</p>



<p>McDonnell misreported that Kobayashi is 23 years old, rather than 30, and members of Kobayashi&#8217;s family, who had been posting updates on a Facebook page, complainted they were not contacted by the LAPD prior to McDonnell&#8217;s statement.</p>



<p>The Facebook page that was focused on the search efforts was taken down.</p>



<p>On Sunday, Nov. 24, police said they found Kobayashi&#8217;s father, Ryan, dead by suicide near LAX, after he had traveled to Los Angeles from Hawaii to assist in the search efforts.</p>



<p>Ryan Kobayashi was 58 and <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/la-county-medical-examiner-reveals-cause-of-death-for-ryan-kobayashi-father-of-missing-hawaii-woman/3570558/">died as the result of multiple blunt force traumatic injuries</a>, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>The Los Angeles Police Department announced Monday the case of Hannah Kobayashi, the woman from Hawaii who vanished last month after landing at LAX, is now a voluntary missing person case, explaining its investigators have video evidence of Kobayashi crossing the border into Mexico on foot.</p>



<p>Law enforcement sources had confirmed to NBC Los Angeles that Kobayashi was believed to be in Mexico, and there was no evidence of foul play in her disappearance. </p>



<p>&#8220;We reviewed video surveillance from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which clearly shows Kobayashi crossing the United States border on foot into Mexico. She was alone with her luggage and appeared unharmed,&#8221; LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said during a news conference Monday.</p>



<p>The LAPD officials also confirmed Kobayashi walked through the tunnel at the San Ysidro Port of Entry alone.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an adult and she can choose to be missing,&#8221; one senior law enforcement official told NBCLA, and added that detectives still hoped Kobayashi would get in touch with authorities so they could confirm she&#8217;s safe and traveling of her own free will.</p>

<p>Authorities searching for a homicide suspect who used bedsheets to escape from a northwestern Pennsylvania jail last week say items found in the last 24 hours lead them to believe he is still in the area.</p>



<p>Authorities added that reward money in the case has more than doubled.</p>



<p>Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police earlier said campsites and small stockpiles believed to be related to escapee Michael Burham had been found, and he said Tuesday that searchers &#8220;are still finding some items that we do believe are connected to him.”</p>



<p>“Those lead me to believe that there is still a likelihood that he is here; I also look at the absence of proof that he has gone anywhere else,” Bivens told reporters in a regular late afternoon news conference at the Youngsville, Pennsylvania, municipal building.</p>



<p>Burham, 34, fled the Warren County Prison late Thursday by climbing on exercise equipment, climbing through a window and then down a rope fashioned from jail bedding, authorities said. Burham was being held on $1 million bail and was charged with kidnapping, burglary and other counts.</p>



<p>Bivens said searchers have been investigating possible sightings and break-ins of unoccupied structures or cabins, using technology such as DNA to see if Burham is connected to them. But so far no link to him had been confirmed, Bivens said.</p>



<p>“I have a strong belief that he is receiving help,” Bivens said, repeating a warning that such actions would have consequences. “Again, I caution anyone that is currently giving help or is contemplating it, we will prosecute you for it.”</p>

<p>The addition of a $10,000 reward posted by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.crimewatchpa.com/crimestoppers" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Crime Stoppers</a> has raised the total reward money in the case to $19,500, Bivens said. The U.S. Marshals Service earlier offered $7,500 for information leading to Burham’s capture, and Warren County Crime Stoppers has offered $2,000.</p>



<p>More than 200 state, federal and local law enforcement officers are involved in the manhunt, he said. </p>



<p>Warren County Sheriff Brian Zeybell, asked about the response after the prison escape, said city police were on the scene almost immediately. </p>



<p>“Literally, I would say that Burham saw red and blue lights within two minutes of leaving that jail. They were that close,” he said. Correction officers were in the parking lot within two minutes, he added, saying “the response time couldn’t have been any quicker.”</p>



<p>District Attorney Jason Schmidt of Chautauqua County, New York, said last month that Burham is the prime suspect in the May 11 killing of Kala Hodgkin, 34, and a related arson in Jamestown, New York. Authorities also accuse him of abducting an elderly couple in Pennsylvania while trying to evade capture before his arrest in South Carolina. Burham “is considered very dangerous,” Warren city police said.</p>



<p>Local, multistate and federal authorities have searched numerous residences, abandoned structures and wooded areas using K-9 units and aerial resources such as drones and aircraft, authorities said. </p>



<p>Bivens has said that Burham taught himself survival skills and had military reserve training. </p>



<p>Authorities were searching a very large area with a lot of difficult terrain that has cabins, oil and gas sheds, and shacks that could offer a fugitive a place to hide, officials have said.</p>

<p>The trip of a lifetime turned into a nightmare for one San Diego family. Their 14-year-old daughter is fighting for her life after an overseas trip with her school.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you, baby and just keep pushing,” Jevonnte Allen, Destinee’s father, said.</p>



<p>These are the words a father is sending to his 14-year-old daughter, Destinee Allen, who is thousands of miles away.</p>





<p>Allen said having his daughter in another country &#8220;fighting for her life&#8221; is making him &#8220;a wreck.&#8221;</p>



<p>Destinee just graduated 8<sup>th</sup> grade from The Language Academy in the College Area where she studied Spanish. Last month, she travelled to Spain with a group of about 20 classmates.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just kept telling her it&#8217;s a once in a lifetime thing to go over there and visit all those places,” Allen said.</p>



<p>Just a few days into her trip, Allen got a call from his daughter.</p>



<p>&#8220;About three days later we start hearing that she wasn&#8217;t feeling too good, once they made it to Barcelona,” Allen said.</p>



<p>Her father said they first thought Destinee had contracted a cold, but her fever was spiking up to 103 degrees.</p>



<p>Destinee’s mother, Whitney Williams, said doctors ran tests, told her she had an infection and gave her antibiotics.</p>



<p>“I would say, about a day or two of her taking antibiotics, she just seemed to have been getting worse,” Williams said.</p>



<p>She said the infection became septic.</p>



<p>“With her having a heart condition, it caused her to have issues with her heart rate and septic made her to have low blood pressure and found out that she had an infection in her organs and so they transferred her to the hospital where she is now and placed her in the ICU so that they can better care for her,” Williams said.</p>



<p>That’s when Williams took a flight to go see her. Allen said it took a while to identify what was wrong.</p>



<p>&#8220;We were just, barely got to identify that it was pneumonia, for the first couple of days we knew nothing,” Allen said.</p>



<p>This scare also opened past wounds. Just seven years ago they lost their younger son, Cayden, to a heart condition.</p>



<p>&#8220;With my son, we went through so much for two to three years, in and out the hospital, there for six months, you just have to have faith in God,” Allen said. </p>



<p>&#8220;My baby not coming home, that was my biggest concern when all this was going on and they couldn&#8217;t find out what it is, but now as the days pass, my baby is going to be home. She&#8217;s a fighter and I feel like she&#8217;s going to make it happen. There&#8217;s going to be a happy ending to this story,&#8221; Allen added.</p>



<p>Williams said doctors told her she may be discharged next week, but she might need to wait several weeks before taking a trip back home.</p>
